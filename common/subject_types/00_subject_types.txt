# OBS! Full modding not supported. Code support still needed to remove/rename the original subject types.
# Custom ones CAN be created with scriptable diplomatic actions (see "dummy" at the bottom of this file), although this is not currently very functional.

# If used, copy_from should be put at the very top ( things above it will be overwitten )

# Triggers will be evaluated in the scope of the Subject, with the Overlord as its FROM scope.
# Exception: is_potential_overlord is evaluated in the scope of the potential Overlord, with no particular subject in mind.

# count = x is used (means it "counts as" x in some triggers).

# copy_from copies everything except count, is_potential_overlord, and can_be_established

# relative_power_class decides how Subjects are grouped together when considering relative strenghth towards overlord:
# If it is 0 they won't consider relative power and if it is 1 they will only consider their own power (and those supporting their independence) compared to their Overlord's.
# Otherwise they will sum up the power of every Subject of the same relative_power_class as themselves, and all countries who support either themselves or one of their allies in the same relative_power_class.

# diplomacy_view_class decides how subjects are grouped together in diplomacy view and in foreign province view:
# 0 means it won't be listed
# 1 means it will be listed together only with the same subject type
# Other values means it will be listed together with all subjects of the same diplomacy_view_class

# The following status checks are considered in old triggers:

# is_colonial_nation  & is_former_colonial_nation
#        checks the 'has_colonial_parent = yes' attribute

# is_lesser_in_union, junior_union_with, senior_union_with & years_in_union_under
#		checks the 'has_overlords_ruler = yes' attribute


# Forward declaring all subject types so they can refer to each other in triggers etc.
