Such fortresses are rumored to have been maintained continuously since well before the time of Achilles and Agamemnon. Whatever be the case; They do their job exceptionally well, we ought to ensure they continue to do so in perpetuity, long may our Thebes be protected."

Let other cities stick to frail concepts of 'honor' and a 'common identity' and let's see how well it serves them. We shall remain opportunistic in picking our allies, in picking our enemies, and in switching them around at a moment's notice. Thebes works only for the sake of Thebes, all else is inconsequential."

People that wish for nothing but the worst of ills upon our city and our people. We must weather whatever ill or ruin they may try to rain upon us, and we must be able to rebuild and bounce back ever-stronger each time. We are determined to endure, we are determined to prevail, and prevail we shall."
 THH_dams_and_drains:0 "Dams and Drains"
 THH_dams_and_drains_desc:0 "Lake Kopais, upon which's shores our city is build, never fails to prove how big of a hindrance it is to our growth and development. There are stories circulating in Boeotia of an old Pelasgian people who -through masterful engineering and effort- managed to drain the entirety of the lake through a complex and intricate system of dams, drains, and cisterns. If the Pelasgians of all people managed to pull off such a worthy feat, then it should be child's play for us."
 thessalian_ties:0 "Ties with Thessalians"
 thessalian_ties_desc:0 "Some toponyms and the common Aeolic dialect indicate that the Boeotians were related to the Thessalians. Traditionally, the Boeotians are said to have originally occupied Thessaly, the largest fertile plain in Greece, and to have been dispossessed by the north-western Thessalians two generations after the Fall of Troy (1200 BC). They moved south and settled in another rich plain, while others filtered across the Aegean and settled on Lesbos and in Aeolis in Asia Minor. Others are said to have stayed in Thessaly, withdrawing into the hill country and becoming the perioikoi (serfs)."

 resisting_thebes:0 "Resisting Thebes"
 resisting_thebes_desc:0 "While the Boeotians, unlike the Arcadians, generally acted as a united whole against foreign enemies, the constant struggle between the cities was a serious check on the nation's development. Boeotia hardly figures in history before the late 6th century BC. It was the constant ambition of the Thebans to absorb the other townships into a single state, just as Athens had annexed the Attic communities. But the outlying cities successfully resisted this policy, and only allowed the formation of a loose federation that, initially, was merely religious."

While we've never really accepted the validity of that myth in the first place, the Argives seem to take great pride in that regardless. Argive favor can, perhaps, help us along in the Panhellenic stage? It could certainly prove helpful."
 EPD_bring_about_the_artisans:0 "Bring about the Artisans"
 EPD_bring_about_the_artisans_desc:0 "If we are to leave a lasting impact, it should be through the arts and sciences we sponsor, not through the brutish barbarisms of war.

 EPD_temples_and_theaters:0 "Temples and Theaters"
 EPD_temples_and_theaters_desc:0 "When times are rough, people will either flock to religion or to a good laugh. We luckily happen to serve both. We should expand our facilities and create truly remarkable temple complexes and theaters, enough to drown all sorrow and unrest and then some."
 EPD_honor_asclepius:0 "Honor Asclepius"
 EPD_honor_asclepius_desc:0 "Our patron, Asclepius, was a great man of the sciences. A doctor with no compare, capable of even bringing people back from Hades's clutches. While we can never truly recreate such achievements, we should strive to live up to his memory to the best of our ability. We will further our understanding of this world and keep our people healthy, it is our duty as the chosen of Asclepius."
 EPD_wealth_in_the_seas:0 "Wealth in the Seas"
 EPD_wealth_in_the_seas_desc:0 "There's not much to be gained from the land in Epidauria, the ground is simply not good enough to let us prosper. Luckily, the seas can help us.

 EPD_prep_up_epidauria:0 "Enrich our Homeland"
 EPD_prep_up_epidauria_desc:0 "Our home is not vast, it does not demand the respect of a dozen others, it has never tried to assert itself in panhellenic affairs.

We shall all do our best to make the most out of our home, to make it the best it can be."
 EPD_stay_neutral:0 "Maintain our Neutrality"
 EPD_stay_neutral_desc:0 "Turn a blind eye, then another, then another. We cannot hope to face some threats, be they too big, too complex, too overwhelming. Sometimes it's best to play the roll of the houseplant and just do nothing. A vast army burns Corinth? Invite it's general for diner.

 EPM_monopolise_illyria:0 "Monopoly in Illyria"
 EPM_monopolise_illyria_desc:0 "It is a fact that most greeks will prefer to trade for Illyrian goods with us rather than the Illyrians themselves, we could use this to assert our stranglehold in the region's trade. Through some gentle persuassion, if we make the Illyrians more willing to exchange their goods with us, the more we'll have to sell to the greek world, and the more they'll demand of our goods. And who knows? Eventually we might be able to expand this operation even more."
 EPM_reconcile_our_factions:0 "Reconcile our Factions"
 EPM_reconcile_our_factions_desc:0 "The struggle between our democratic and oligarchic factions has been nothing but a ceaseless source of political unrest ever since the very founding of city, it has brought more ruin to our city than it has had any right to. If we don't work to reconcile these two factions by finding a middle ground that serves both their interests, then we fear that something truly terrible might happen."
 EPM_epidamnation:0 "Strike Fear"
 EPM_epidamnation_desc:0 "Some of the barbarians in Italy have correlated the name of our city to 'Damnation', they consider this very name a bad omen, they refuse to even call us by it. This blatant slander cannot stand. If they want to fear us so much then we should give a proper reason to fear, something much more real than 'bad omens'. Let our ships and sailors be their true 'damnation'."
 EPM_recruiting_illyrians:0 "Recruiting the Illyrians"
 EPM_recruiting_illyrians_desc:0 "There is one indisputable fact about our neighbors here in Illyria; They are great warriors. And there is another fact about us; Our ranks are greatly undermanned, and our city is simply not populous enough to deal with the many threats it faces. We should try to co-erce the Illyrians to fight for us, perhaps by tolerating some of their customs to boot, no matter how much our elite may complain about that. The matter of our very survival is well above their Chauvinism."

Some scholars have put forward evidence that the language belonged to the Anatolian branch of Indo-European and was similar, in particular, to Paeonian-Mysian. There may also have been cultural links to the Ligurians and Illyrians (who were native to the western Balkans).

Others went west, colonizing the central coastal Portuguese region of Estremadura and became known as Turduli Oppidani. Some went south, where they settled the present Setubal peninsula along the Tagus river mouth and the lower Sardum river valley as the Bardili.
