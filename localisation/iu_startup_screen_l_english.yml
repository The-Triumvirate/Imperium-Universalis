 string_start_elam_kingdom_description:0 "The current state of the Kingdom of Elam is not the best as the nation was ravaged and sacked just over 27 years ago, when the assyrians in their full might led by King Ashurbanipal himself mobilized all their army East as to annex and destroy the Elamite Kingdom of the Tahrid dynasty as they had being meddling in assyrian affairs in Lower Mesopotamia and the Zagros Mountains for well over a century, culminating in a babylonian revolt that even saw the death of an Assyrian prince.\n\nAs this offense was of the highest levels the assyrians took no reserves in leveling to the ground the once former great city of Susa and also other elamite cities, this level of destruction and exhaustion of the elamite army caused a rapid fragmentation of the Neo Elamite empire which quickly saw it's dominions in the very birthplace of Elam, Anshan, fall to migrating tribes of iranians who were once irrelevant in the geopolitcal scenario btu now are known as the Persians.\n\nHowever this would not be the only loses for Elam as most power would decentralized and former provinces of the empire will declare indepence from Susa forming their own dynasties and naming themselves as Sukkal(King), but this would not had being the total disintegration of Elam in to various petty Kingdoms thanks to branches of the Tahrid dynasty taking control over large settlements like Susa, Madaktu and Hidali and also the present existential threat of both Iranians and Assyrians that had profited off Elam's collapse, these factors led to those newly found kingdoms uniting nominally for protection under the authority of the Tahrids at Susa by recognizing the ruler there as Sukkal Makh or High King a title that used to be proclaim in antiquity; showing the contrast between a currently decentralized Elam and it's former highly bureaucratic empire.\n\nThough the authority of the Sukkal Makh is fragile and the loss of any other major city would be devastating for the elamite morale, Elam is still one of the world's richest and most populated regions, a sufficiently skilled leadership could possibly unite the Kingdoms of Aiapir, Durum, Gisati, Hidali, Rashi, Samati, Susun, Zamin and Zari in to a coherent elamite entity by slowly reconstructing the administration or by conquest. Historically Elam never recovered with most of the neo elamite legacy being lost and elamite culture, religion and language dying off."

 string_start_government_monarchy_elam:0 "The High Kingdom of Elam is ruled over by a Sukkal Makh who currently resides in the city of Susa and is a member of the Tahrid dynasty who acts as the military leader to a coalition of different minor elamite kings(Sukkal), these Sukkal are bound to give tribute to the Sukkal Makh whose authority is still unstable as he can't fully control the Sukkal's territory. If the authority of the Sukkal Makh becomes too weak, a powerful enough Sukkal might try to replace him as Sukkal Makh, it is also very important for the integrity of the High Kingdom to mantain control over the Capitals of Elam at any cost as losing this cities (specially Susa) will seal the fate of Elam as a fading nation."
 string_start_elamite_region_desc:0 "Haltamti is the elamite name for Elam, the region is surrounded to it's North and East by the Zagros Mountains who posses a fertile soil and a humid mediterranean climate good enough to sustain large cities like Madaktu or Hidali, the South of Elam is dry but not desertic and it's coast is characterized by it's mangrove forest who remain very reduced in size in modern times, the Center of the region is the most populated and important one as it holds the city of Susa and the Pasitigris river(modern Karun) that with it's waters forms an alluvial plain in combination with the Tigris river that sustains the irrigation complexes feeding the population, the North-West is dominated by the Mesopotamian Steppe. In this context the High Kingdom of Elam tries to survive the powers from the Iranian Plateau and the Mesopotamian Valley."

 string_start_title_panchala:0 "Panchaladesa"
 string_start_title_panchala_description:0 "According to the Vedas, the current Panchala was formed by the union of five different tribes or Janas; the Krivis, the Somakas, the Keshins, the Srinjayas and the Turvashas, all of whom were Aryas that followed Brahmanic orthodox tradition.\n\nFollowing to Mahabharata the land that was the Panchaladesa much like other lands was divided in two, Uttarapanchala and Dakshinapanchala (Northern and Southern Panchala) with the capital of the North located at Ahicchatra and that of the South at Kampilyanagara, the king of the latter was Drupada father of the Pandava wife Draupadi, who in the Epic joins the side of the Pandava brothers, unites Panchala and helps them in recovering the throne of Kuru.\n\nFollowing the Kurukshetra war the kings of Panchala would remain in friendly terms with the Kuru as both kshatriya dynasties were related by the way of belonging to the Lunar dynasty or Chandravamsha, however, this situation would not last as the Kuru kingdom quickly declined due to the destruction of it's capital of Hastinapura by a catastrophic flooding and it's subsequent invasion by mleccha tribes such as the Salva, in spite of these events, Panchala would remain unscathed and would even go on to take Kuru's previous position as the strongest Vedic nation and protectors of the Brahmanical tradition.\n\nWith Kuru on the decline the Panchala leadership organized by King Keshin Dhalbya, would go on to pretty much merge the two nations in one forming the cultural and political power of the Kuru-Panchalas who became benefactors of brahmanic orthodoxy and leaders of the Panchala hegemony that ruled over North India for the rest of the Late Vedic Age, 9th to 7th century.\n\nFrom it's position as Hegemon of North India, Panchala would enter a golden age and find the apex of it's power with the rule of it's most prominent post-Mahabharata King, Pravahana Jaivali who is mentioned as king of Panchala in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. Pravahana, who was a son of the Dhalbya prince Jaivala, was reknown for his great wisdom equal to that of an Acharya Rishi and for his theological advancements to Hinduism such as his doctrine of the Five Fires and speculations on Moksha, for this reason he was recognized by the title of Darshanika(Philosopher) and usually addressed as a Philosopher-King, he also held a Tattvajnana Parisad (Seminar of Philosophers) and was contemporary as well as Master of other philosophers like Asvapati Ikshvaku and Janaka Videha.\n\nAccording to Vayu Purana following the 7th century there were 25 unnamed kings of Panchala of unknown dynasty and information of the country becomes more scarce hinting to perhaps that after the death of Pravahana, Panchala underwent a gradual decline of it's power and might had even become an oligarchy instead of a monarchy as the country is addressed in Jataka not as a kingdom but simply as a Desa, unlike other nations like Vatsa, Kosala or Magadha.\n\nWith the decline of Panchala it's hegemony would be broken and the once dominant religious position of the Nastika tradition would be challenged by the newer Astika school as the former entered in to a period of transition and decline due the rising influence and power of Sramana countries from the East such as Magadha."

 string_start_title_kosala_description:0 "The Kosala Kingdom was founded by the Ikshvaku or Solar Dynasty and has remained under their control until now, with a total of 30 Ikhsvaku kings, with some of the most famous being King Rama and Brhadbala, the former being the main character of the Ramayana and an incarnation of Vishnu and the latter a contemporary of the Kurukshetra War. The line of the Ikshvaku expanded outside of Kosala proper and formed minor branches such as those of Dakshina Kosala, Ashmaka, Sakya and Koliya.\n\nThe capital of ancient Kosala was located at the city of Saketa which is modern Ayodhya, a holy city of Hinduism, inside of Kosala there was also the city of Shravasti which according to the Pali Cannon was one of the greatest cities in India. Following the rule of Rama and his son, Kosala declined and it's territory diminished to the area containing these two cities and the Kingdom became small and weak and even is mentioned as being under vassalage of the neighbouring Kashi Kingdom.\n\nKosala's fortune changed over time as the family of the current Kosala King, Mahakosala, took power as they were capable leaders and managed to restablish the lost power by waging war against the Kashi and turning the tables on them by vassalizing them as well as subjugating other smaller kingdoms like that of the Sakyas.\n\nThe Kosalas were patrons of Sramana ascetics and brahmanas and in Jataka their kings were pious rulers with King Mahakosala giving land to learned sages or Mahasalas, this gave them great prestige and the King and his son Prasenajit extended their kingdom over a vast territory after annexing Kashi, making Kosala a very powerful country that entered in conflict with the Magadha of the Haryankas. Kosala according to Buddhist tradition converted to Buddhism and became an important religious center.\n\nKosala's last king was Prasenajit, a contemporary of the Buddha, who has forced to abdicate by his son Virudhaka that led the Kingdom to ruin and finally to it's annexation by Magadha."

 string_start_title_anga_description:0 "The Kingdom of Anga was founded by Prince Anga son of Bali of the Lunar Dynasty after he built the city of Champa which was located east of Magadha in modern Bengal at the confluence of the Champa and Ganga rivers, in Mahabharta the Kingdom was conquered by Karna along with the rest of Vanga for the Kauravas.\n\nThe kings of Anga following the Kurukshetra war are mostly unknown with the Jains mentioning a King called Dadhivahana as a contemporary of Mahavira while in the Matsya Purana it is mentioned that Anga had mantained an unbroken dynastic line, it's also said that Champa became a major and revered trading city that connected East to West and one of the greatest of India.\n\nIn the Vidhura-Pandita Jataka, Anga is mentioned as a powerful Kingdom that once dominated over it's neighbour Magadha as it conquered the city of Girivraja (Magadha's capital), the occupation of Magadha did not last and this led to the two countries becoming bitter rivals. Anga ultimately declined while Magadha flourished and once the Haryanka king, Bimbisara, took power of Girivraja, he led an invasion of Anga and was succesful in doing so as Anga was already a part of Magadha during the Buddha's lifetime."

 string_start_title_kashi_description:0 "According to Jataka and Mahavagga, the Kashi Mahajanapada was once a very powerful Kingdom with Imperial ambitions that ruled over a vast territory and had a large number of subject kingdoms or tributaries from Kosala all the way down to Potali. From this power Kashi became very rich and flourished as the kingdom became synonimous with wealth and luxury, with it's capital of Varanasi being an extremely rich city as well as a Holy site.\n\nThis prosperity ended as the previous dynasty of Kashi (which remains unnamed) became corrupted from luxury and lost Danda Niti and was subsequently overthrown by king Brahmadatta of the Bharata line, in spite of this, the new dynasty of Kashi was incapable of reverting the decadence of the country and rather the kingdom declined further, with it splitting in three parts, one eastern (Kashi proper), a western one (Aparakasis) and a quarter of it being conquered by Kosala (Kasikosala).\n\nWith Kashi on the decline, their former vassal of Kosala, who used to be an insignificant kingdom, came to replace the crumbling country as the dominant force on the region as it continued to wage war against their former master, until the Kashis surrendered and the Kingdom was vassalized by Kosala.\n\nUnder Kosala rule Kashi would stabilize but it would never recover it's independence as it was during the reign of kosalan king, Mahakosala, that the country was fully annexed."

The Epic as well as Ramayana also trace the dynastic line of the Gandhara, in the two books the Gandhari people are descendants from prince Druhyu, who was a son of Yayati a great grandson of king Pururavas, which made him a member of the Chandravamsha dynasty, however, he rejected the Vedas and commited himself to a life devoid of Dharma which made him a Mleccha, but his kin, king Gandhara reconnected with his aryan legacy and founded the kingdom of Gandhara with the later king Taksha founding the city of Takshasila and dedicating it to scholarship, this stabilized the Druhyu dynasty and they continued to rule Gandhara.\n\nBy the Late Vedic Age, Gandhara was the most powerful and richest country of North-West with the country located on a border region between Aryan India and the mleccha tribes to the west of the Sindhu river such as the Kamboja, with it's capital of Takshashila being the scholar center of North India, as the city possessed the famous University of Taxila, an educational complex in which learned Acharyas from all parts of India came in reunion to teach and practice scholarship and study, with some of it's most famous members being the grammarian Panini or the statesman Kautilya and Chanakya.\n\nAccording to Kumbhakara Jataka the king of Gandhara by the life of the Buddha was Nagnajit who was a Druhyu, the jains also mention Nagnajit as a scholarly ruler of Gandhara."

The position of the Kambojas as an irrelevant nation changes by the time of the Mahabharata where they are mentioned multiple times and along with a similar people, the Daradas, are conquered by Arjuna and Karna for Pandavas and Kauravas respectively.\n\nSince the Mahabharata, the Kamboja rose to power by expanding and becoming an economic power thanks to it's great pastures that were capable of sustaining large flocks of cattle, horses and sheep that they then exported to the countries of the east, from their pastures the Kamboja became a fertile people and their numbers grew so much that their soldiers started to being contracted as mercenaries.\n\nDue to their position to the west of the Sindhu river and as a frontier nation, the Kambojas were not considered to be aryan by the rest of the Indian countries and were treated as Mleccha barbarians, even the Jatakas denounce Kamboja as a country that should be avoided due to their savage customs, the Jatakas also mention independent Kamboja tribes that were not related to the Kingdom of Kamboja proper and that were even more backwards."

They were located on the Vanga region and were enemies of the Vanga and Pundra Kingdoms, they were divided in multiple tribes that were considered barbaric and savage by the aryans, however, one among them, the Kingdom of Khasira, was the most powerful and had it's capital at Khasinagara. Like other countries of Vanga, the Khasira were invaded by Karna in the name of the Kauravas but they surrendered and were spared from annihilation.\n\nThe Khasiras are the ancestors of the modern Khasi people that live in modern Megalaya."

According to the Vedas their ruling dynasties were from the Chandravamsha line and were once united as a single people but separate over time in two kingdoms. By the time of the Mahaharata the kingdoms are united as one under the rule of King Jayadratha who forms a large empire, but because he allied with the Kauravas and kidnapped Draupdadi his kingdom is ruined by the Pandavas and he's killed, the Sindhus and Sauviras are also mentioned as some of the finest and most skilled soldiers of the war and their martial prowess is revered.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, the lack of a strong leadership that could hold together the martial sindhu sauviran peoples made the empire of Jayadratha collapsed and the two kingdoms gained independence and became bitter rivals over the legacy of Jayadratha and waged war to each other for generations.\n\nEventually the Sauvirans would come out as victors of the conflict by annexing Sindhu, they then established their capital at the trading city of Roruka which had been founded as the capital of Renu's kingdom (the father of Jayadratha), the union would be momentary as the exhausted Sauvira were incapable of resisting the Achaemenid invasions of Darius the Great and were annexed as the Satrapy of Hindush."

Ashmaka was king during the Kurukshetra war and took the side of the Pandavas, his brother Mulaka was also son of Kalmasapada but his mother was Madayanti.\n\nFollowing the origin of the two Kingdoms not much is known of their history in Brahmanical Sources, but in the Anguttara Nikaya the Kingdom of Ashmaka is mentioned as a Mahajanapada, which means that Ashmaka grew it's influence and became a powerful country of the South, here it is also said that Ashmaka was transformed in to a hegemon of Maharashtra by imposing itself over Mulaka and waging war against both Avanti and Kalinga, two rival countries of the Dakshinapatha."

During the Kurukshetra war there were two joint kings of Avanti, Vinda and Annvinda while Nila was the king of Heheya who was conquered by Sahadeva.\n\nIn the Matsya Purana, Avanti is named after prince Avanti, a son of the Heheya king Karttavyria, a great conqueror of the Nagas of Lanka, the latter of which was a member of the Vitihotra clan, a branch of the Yadavas that dominated the politics of Heheya.\n\nAfter the Kurukshetra war it is known that Heheya started to decline and lost much of it's power as it stagnated and was conquered by foreign countries. It is thanks to the weakening of Mahishmati, that the northern half of Avanti or Ujjayini finally was able to break away from the control of the Heheya and became independent and started to be ruled by a cadet branch of the Vitihotra clan which were named Vitahvyas.\n\nThe Vitahvyas much like their Vitihotra predecessors managed to establish in Ujjayini a very powerful Kingdom that surpassed and even replaced the Heheya by waging war against them and conquering Mahishmati, but like their predecessors the Vitahvyas also started to stagnate, lost Danda Niti, and eventually were overthrown by their general and advisor, Pradyota, who was great ruler that transformed the country in to the competing power for the dominion of the Jambudvipa.\n\nThe dynasty founded by Pradyota would go on to conquer huge parts of India and wage war with Magadha for over two centuries until it's defeat and annexation by the Mauryan Empire."

After Siradhvaja another 17 kings of the Ikhsvaku line would succeeded to the throne of Videha with the last independent king being Krti who ruled before Videha was absorbed in to Vajji.\n\nIn the traditional accounts all of these rulers take on the name of Janaka as either a personal name or a title.\n\nIn Shatapatha Brahmana it is mentioned of one Janaka as a ruler of Videha and how he was a Samrat, in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad this same Janaka is mentioned as he features prominently as a Philosopher-King who was even a student from Pravahana of Panchala as his court received visits from sages coming from Kuru-Panchala.\n\nIt is from the fame of this Janaka that the Kingdom of Videha received fame for it's intellectual and scholarly superiority when compared to his neighbours and the stories of many Janakas are also compiled on the Jataka as well as in Jain tradition were they are celebrated rulers who also patronized the Sramana philosophy.\n\nBy the end reign of the celebrated Janaka line, the kingdom of Videha would weaken and was annexed by the neighbouring confederation of Vajji."

In these accounts, Vajji is a confederation of eight clans or Kulas, chief among them being the Licchavi clan who had it's seat at the city of Vaishali which was therefore the capital of the whole Confederation.\n\nOther clans included the Videhas of Mithila (who used to be an independent kingdom), the Vajjis, the Jnatrkas who were also from Vaishali, the Bhaggas of Sumsumara, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Kalamas of Kesaputta and the Moriyas of Pippalivana. The Sakyas of Kapilavastu and the Koliyas of Ramagama were also subjugated by Vajji but were independent of the confederation.\n\nThe history of Vajji is the the most important for the Jain religion as according to their tradition the clan of the Jnatrkas produced Mahavira and Siddhartha, the country is also visited by Buddha and in buddhist tradition the Licchavi are presented as very numerous clan that protects the whole confederation."

Before that the country is also known for being a Brahmana-hating country and thus Parashurama (the brahmin Dashavatara) exterminates all the Kshatriya of Vanga and it is for these reasons that Vanga fell in to ruin and it is considered as Mleccha country that should be shunned and avoided by aryans.\n\nIn Jain tradition the country of Vanga is in a different position as it is counted as a member of the Solasa Mahajanapadas, the region was also famous for it's maritime traditions and it could possibly be the location of the Kingdom of Simhapura, the ancestor Kingdom of the Sinhala people."

 string_start_title_slavic_description:0 "History of early slavic people begins around 1000 BC, when numerous Slavic tribes began to inhabit the northern and central parts of the East-European Plain. They were settled and lived off hunting, fishing, farming and those living in the steppes also cattle-breeding.\n\nThey mostly lived peacefully mixing with other tribes living under their protection and moving when they did, one tribe in particular the Sporoi who used to live under Scythian tribe of Spalaei moved closer to Baltic with the youngest tribe of Royal Scythians, eventually turning into Veneti the earliest tribe where slavic people became dominant.\n\nRight until the settling of Slavic tribes in VI to VIII centuries they were mostly peaceful and did not achieve anything of note."

 string_start_title_nordic_description:0 "Iron Age began in Scandinavia with introduction of ferrous metallurgy from exposure to La Tene and Halstatt cultures. This sparked a rapid change in local culture, bringing them closer to intense agriculture centered around larger settlements, introduction of slaves and increasing trade relations with nations across the sea.\n\nAs iron production from bog iron started, it sparked conflicts across Scandinavia, while we do not know much about it, there are clear signs of conflicts between Dani, Geat, Svei and Theusti tribes.\n\nWhile possibly not the best place for a rising civilization, the coldest years are far ahead of them, this is your perfect opportunity to shape this place into something to be remembered."

 string_start_title_goidelic_description:0 "Celtic migrations to Ireland have been a thing since 800 BC, extremely unruly people who have spent most of the period fighting between themselves when not trying to fight off next wave of migrating tribes or raiding Caledonia and Britain. Despite this mentality they engaged in trade frequently and were on par with British tribes.\n\nWhile not the worst place to start your civilization, threat of migrating tribes taking over your land, strained relationship with British and Caledonian tribes, a challenge befitting the people inhabiting this land."

 string_start_title_westafrican:0 "West African Tribes"
 string_start_title_westafrican_description:0 "While little is known about Western African tribes of this time, there is some evidence which was used to construct this particular setup. Conflicts in the Nok region have triggered migration of the Bozo people along the Niger river right until the western coast, bringing them to conflict with coastal Idogo tribes.\n\nTo make things worse Daradae tribes also migrated along the river from more desert filled regions in search of a better life, becoming third side of this conflict. Most other tribes were struggling to unite the people of their region represented by colonization in the mod.\n\nThis is extremely slow start which nonetheless can lead you into a fun playthrough as West Africa connects to most of Africa, allowing easy access to riches of Egypt, Arabian trade, Mediterranean Mare Internum or Hispania."
