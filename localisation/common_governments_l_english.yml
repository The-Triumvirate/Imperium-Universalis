 mleccha_kingdom_reform:0 "Mlechcha Tribe"
 mleccha_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "Mleccha was a term used in ancient India similar to that of barbarian as the root of the word (Mlech) comes from the onomatopeia to simbolise saying a bunch of gibberish so the term later evolved to mean an unintelligible language that for the sanskrit speaking indians sounded like nonsense, so the term mleccha became to be applied to any non-indian either outside of it or for the native populations the indians encountered. In Mahabharata the mlecchas are born from the left part of the corpse of Vena (the same corpse from which Prthu arose) thus representing the evil that was within Venu so mleccha further evolve to mean wicked peoples that were not only foreigners but that were sinners who did not hold the Dharma and for this reason the aryans loathed the mlecchas subjugating them to live in the forests and hills. From this latter interpretation it could be say mleccha also encompased even ethnically indian people who were not viewed as aryan or kshatriya due to their religious practices as it can be seen in further literature how countries like Anga or Kalinga are to be avoided and did not deserve of Sradda rituals."

This version was mainly propose by Kautalyia as a mans to envision the origins of State in humanity and not on the divine. The King was granted the ability to punish peopel and levy taxes while he had to guarantee the maintenance of Yogakshema (social welfare). In other indian traditions like those of Mahabharata or Digha Nikaya there's emphasis also on how the first King was Manu and that his reign arose from the contract between him and the people to deliver them from anarchy and the state of nature. \n§YSelecting this reform will allow you to reform to a Republic!"

To overcome this problem the achaemenian administration relied on the elamite administration (an inheritance from the kingdom of Anshan), made use of extensive bureaucracy and continue the practice of the assyrians in appointing governors to rule over areas that the king could not, scribes and systems of couriers and royal posts; also with the genius of great rulers such as Cyrus and Darius they managed to establish the satrapal system that was the central pillar of their provincial administration which consisted of large administrative units that had a fixated tribute system that was relative to the province's wealth and which satrap was elected and regulated by the King of Kings but at the same time had enough autonomy to oversee actions that would otherwise be impossible to mantain by a sole person; however other innovation the achaemenids introduced was their approach to multicultiralism as they allowed for the conquered peoples to continue their traditions and giving them a certain degree of autonomy at local levels it was also custom for the persian kings to adopt themselves traditions of their subjects and present to them as another of their Kings and liberators of opression rather than foreign conquerors. In a sense the achaemenids established the importance of local autonomy while at the same mantaining large administrative efficiency and the absolutism (not despotism) of the monarch and his imperial authority by his delegated satraps."
