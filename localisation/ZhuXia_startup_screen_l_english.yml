 string_start_religion_chinese_religion: "\"LiYue\" represents the rites and traditions established by the Zhou dynasty circa 1046 BC, \"JiaoHua\" represents respecting the Zhou as the true Kings of the realm. This differs from §RLiYueBaDao§!, who took on the rites and customs of the Zhou, but do not respect the Zhou's position as King.\n\nAt the start of the game, most Chinese states are §YLiYue-JiaoHua§!, except for §RChu§!, who is openly defying the Zhou. §YQin§! may also join §RChu§! in their defiance. §YLiYue-JiaoHua§! uses the Papacy mechanics from base EU4, called the Zhou court in IU. The controller of the Court is called the §YQingshi§! (high official). Lower officials are called §YZhou-Wang'DaFus§! (lit. Lower Officials of the Zhou King), and will increase a state's influence at court. Despite the loss of much of their de-facto power, the Zhou are still widely respected across China, and control of the court comes with a number of benefits.\n\nBy 253, new religions such as §YConfucianism§! and §YTaoism§! will spawn, however, they can only be adopted once the ZhuXia is dismantled. This is because the §YBaZhu§! (hegemon) is the leader of the Zhou-centric world, and would not allow new ideologies to be taken up so long as the position is relavent. It will automatically be dismantled if too little Chinese states exist, and the number of states needed for dismantlement decreases as other states simultaniously get larger. At that point, the §YWarring States Period§! begins.\n\n§YConfucianism§! was, to a large degree, the successor to LiYue-JiaoHua, as Confucius sought to restore the old order of the Western Zhou, and to bring back the old rites and rituals that had fallen out of use by his time."
