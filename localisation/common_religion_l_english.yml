 aquitanian_religion:0 "Aquitanian"
 aquitanian_religion_religion_desc:0 "Very little is known about the pre-roman Vasco-Aquitanian religion present in southern gaul and the basque country, though it is known that it was a polytheistic religion with an apparent cult for the mountains and nature. Inscriptions from the Pyrenees show that there was a degree of syncretism in ancient Aquitania as there are votives to both celtic and roman gods, aswell as local deities."
 roman_religion:0 "Dei Consentes"
 roman_religion_religion_desc:0 "Roman religion was polytheistic and borrowed a lot from Etruscans, however relations between Romans and Gods were deeply personal, Romans have been integrating new foreign gods to favour Rome as the goal was to secure cooperation, benevolence and peace, ensuring Rome is favoured by many. Roman law was also religious in nature, so deeply religion was ingrained in the society, highly ceremonial and meticulous it managed to survive integration of Greek practices and only lost to Christianity in times of instability."
 greek_religion:0 "Olympioi"
 greek_religion_religion_desc:0 "Greek Polytheism was a religion based on worship of Deities residing on Mount Olympus, greeks had evolved a lax approach to divinity and portrayed their gods as very human-like with flaws and pettiness of average human worshipper. This Pantheon was founded upon overthrowing the old Titan one, tyrannical Titans have been imprisoned in Tartarus by three brothers, sons of Chronos the head of Titan Pantheon, Zeus became head of the new Pantheon, Poseidon claimed the seas and Hades took over the underworld. Gods influence the humans below them and thus humans were meticulously devout as a collective rather than on personal level. Every god had his own unique behaviour that imprinted on regular people or made changes to their lives, often provoking conflicts, wars or feasts of lechery and debauchery."
 punic_religion:0 "Canaanite"
 punic_religion_religion_desc:0 "Canaanite religion here refers to the different polytheistic practices of the semitic peoples from what is the ancient Levant and though the religion and it's pantheon was similar across the different peoples of the Levant there were still regional differences and specially between different ethnic groups, so this is more of a generalized agrupation. For example, Baal is known as a common deity across semites from Syria and Phoenicia, however, this is just a title meaning 'Lord' which is shared by different deities which shared similar aspects, the gods Hadad and Hammon (aramean and phoenician respectively) share this title. For the Semites in what is the south Levant; Israel, Judah, Moab, Ammon and Edom, their commonality was a chief deity that overshadowed all the others, with the israelites taking it a step further and founding proper Monotheism. The semitic religion of the Levant was also highly syncretistic with the arabian and mesopotamian religions it bordered, with shared deities such as Sin, Dagan and Astarte. When the phoenicians brought their religious practices to their colonies, the gods Melqart and Tanit became pretty popular among the settlers."

The movement was founded by an apprentice to Mahavira by the name of Makkhali Gosala and it's adherents were very dedicated to the ascetic life, to the point that their mendicants and monks were characterised as spending their time naked and fasting. The movement was highly decentralized as according to Jain sutras there existed twelve different sects (named after the twelve disciples of Gosala) and the Ajivika reached it's peak during the reign of Mauryan emperor, Bindusara, as he promoted the religion across his realm and ajivikas were given high official titles that they would retain forming the core of a functionary class. Following the death of Bimbisara the Ajivika movement would decline quickly giving more ground to Jainism and Buddhism with both religions not being very fond of them."

By having less rules for monastic life the Mahasamghika were more concerned for the spread of Buddhism among lay communities. They believed that the teachings of Buddha were to be understood as having two principle levels of truth: conventional truths and ultimate truths, they also think that arahants could still posses human weaknesses.
