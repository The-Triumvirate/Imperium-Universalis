Although in the earlier western Zhou period, the system of noble ranks was quite complicated, it became simplified and acted in a kind of hierarchical way similar to the feudal rank system in Europe. Zi correlated to Viscount, Bo to Earl, Gong to Duke, and so on. Though, that's still a massive oversimplification. For example, 'Gong' could simply be used as the highest form of respect for anyone in a position of power, and 'Zi' could refer to rebellious rulers outside the Zhou court's sphere (like Chu, who called themselves Wang).\n\nThat being said, we could petition the court to give us a higher rank to increase our prestige and legitimacy. We'll need to build up some wealth to send as tribute, and make sure we have good diplomatic relations with them, the higher the better - if they deny our request, it'll hurt our image with the other ZhuXia states."
