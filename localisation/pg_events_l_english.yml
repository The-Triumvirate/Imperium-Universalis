 startup.2.d:0 "Imperium Universalis uses its own population system, separate from EU4! The main implication is that each point of development equals 10.000 people. The second is that each province has a soft limit on how many population it can sustain, called CAPACITY, which is separated between Tribal, Commoner and Upper populations. This (quite heavy) event will apply the Province Size and Province ID to each province of the world, so that these mechanics are able to work. Leave it a few seconds to finish, and enjoy the mod!\nThere is a new (v5.0) way of calculating capacities, if you are doing a campaign with the previous system, you can switch itback through Decisions, Popgrowth Menu. \n\n§RNote§b: you can always toggle it off later on, through the decision. \nTo know when it has finished, try selecting an army and move it. If it does not respond and stays in the same province, it means it hasn't finished yet. You can enter provinces, but any button or 'action' will be paralyzed until the calculations are done."
