 # SLAVES EVENTS AND MODIFIERS
 slaves.1.t:0 "Profit From Slavery"
 #slaves.1.d:0 "Every five years the country will get a certain amount of money from slavery. The amount of money is the depends on your monthly income and your amount of slaves.\n\nProfit from Slavery = (Slaves/100)*(MonthyIncome/100).\n\nAmount of Slaves: §Y[Root.slaves.GetValue]§!\nSlaves to Population Ratio: §Y[Root.var_slaves_pop_ratio.GetValue]% §!"		# old description, stored just in case
 slaves.1.d:0 "Slavery, or any manner of control over other humans, was prevalent in many places across Antiquity. In Imperium Universalis we modeled these interactions with the player: \n1) Contributing a certain % of extra goods produced, depending on their size relative to the normal population and their productivity, 2) Every five years the state will get a certain amount of money from slavery. 3) Slaves can be assigned into manufactories (with enough tech); those won't be counted towards the benefits of sections 1 and 2... BUT \n4) Total amount of slaves (assigned or not) relative to total population will have an impact. The bigger % they become, the worse on social issues (unrest, stability, others) it will be, leading to disasters and even full-scale, Spartacus-like rebellion. \n\nThe extra money is collected every five years in this event, and it depends on your monthly income, the amount of slaves relative to the total population, global autonomy, and your the certain laws affecting slaves.\n \n\nTotal amount of Slaves: §B[Root.slaves_tot_display.GetValue].000§! ([Root.slaves_mnf_display.GetValue].000 in manufactories, [Root.slaves_oth_disp.GetValue].000 somewhere else, [Root.slaves_mnf_display.GetValue].000 newly purchased)  \nTotal free and citizen population: [Root.var_total_pop.GetValue]0.000  \n% Slaves to population, for social purposes: §B[Root.slave_pop_social.GetValue]%§! \n% effect on the economy (at §O[Root.slave_productivity.GetValue]%§! prod., not assigned): §B[Root.slave_pop_economic.GetValue]%§!"

Remember, all this is yearly, must be multiplied x5 to get the effect of this event.\n "

 slaves.1.4:0 "What if they were liberated?"
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_START:0 "To abolish slavery in [Root.GetName] is no simple feat! We must convince all sides of society on changing their way of treating their soon-to-be equals. Without considering a sizeable stability hit, this change will cost a lot of power, although whatever laws and privileges are enacted wll affect this cost. \nBase cost of 300£adm£, 300£dip£, 300£mil£"
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_STATUS:0 "Social status of slaves: Serfdom (+50 each), Chattel Slavery (+100) and State Owned (+150) are more expensive, while Criminal Only has reduced cost (-100 each). "
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_CONDITIONS:0 "Harsher or lenient working conditions determine how much military power is needed (between -50% and +50%)"
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_LAWS:0 "Other laws will reduce either Administrative or Diplomatic cost. Basic laws reduce -10% each, and advanced laws -20%, while Manumission gives -5% and -10% to both Adm and Dip"
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_POPSIZE:0 "Finally, higher or lower slave population will affect total power cost: between -50% and +50% on all three powers."
 SLAVES_EVENT_1_ABOL_TOTAL:0 "Total cost if it was abolished today is [Root.slave_abolish_adm.GetValue]£adm£, [Root.slave_abolish_dip.GetValue]£dip£, [Root.slave_abolish_mil.GetValue]£mil£"

 slaves.2.t:0 "Freedmen have settled"
 slaves.2.d:0 "Be it due to simple demographics or to newly liberated captives, former slaves have found a place to settle around our country. A total of §B[Root.freedmen_new.GetValue] thousand§! have done so. \n\n §RIU Hint§!: you can find which provinces have had a new pop with the modifier 'New Freedmen', it has some trade power bonus so it can be seen in the trade mapmode. \nOnly provinces with growth (>120%) in either commoner or tribal are eligible."
 slaves.2.1:0 "Good luck to them all!"

 SLAVE_4_5:0 "§T100 thousand§!! What did you expect?"

 slaves.5.t:0 "The Slave Trade: price"
 slaves.5.d:0 "And finally, at how much are we willing to purchase slaves. As a rule of thumg, the lifetime average value of a pack of 10 thousand slaves is §Y40¤§! gold. How much are we willing to pay?"
 slaves.5.1:0 "The bare minimum! 20¤."
 SLAVE_5_1_COST:0 "This will cost, approximately, §Y[Root.float_1.GetValue]¤§!. Otherwise, our current budget would allow for §T[Root.float_10.GetValue] thousand§! slaves."

 slaves.5.6:0 "No, stop it."

 slaves.6.t:0 "Slave estate basic privileges"
 slaves.6.d:0 "Hey, we see that you are revoking the 'basic' privileges, wich are Status, Condition and Jobs. These three are the root of the Slaves as an Estate mechanic, and contain all the necessary modifiers. \nThe proper way of 'advancing' them is by adding a new privilege, and choosing which one to advance to. \nAs a punishment, you will be paying the mana cost necessary to enact this reform!
