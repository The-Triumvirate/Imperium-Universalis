 slaves.1.d:0 "Slavery, or any manner of control over other humans, was prevalent in many places across Antiquity. In Imperium Universalis we modeled these interactions with the player: \n1) Contributing a certain % of extra goods produced, depending on their size relative to the normal population and their productivity, 2) Every five years the state will get a certain amount of money from slavery. 3) Slaves can be assigned into manufactories (with enough tech); those won't be counted towards the benefits of sections 1 and 2... BUT \n4) Total amount of slaves (assigned or not) relative to total population will have an impact. The bigger % they become, the worse on social issues (unrest, stability, others) it will be, leading to disasters and even full-scale, Spartacus-like rebellion. \n\nThe extra money is collected every five years in this event, and it depends on your monthly income, the amount of slaves relative to the total population, global autonomy, and your the certain laws affecting slaves.\n \n\nTotal amount of Slaves: §B[Root.slaves_tot_display.GetValue].000§!
