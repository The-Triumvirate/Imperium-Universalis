 mleccha_3:0 "In the Shadow of Aryavarta"
 mleccha_3_desc:0 "Mlecchas would be heavily influenced by Indo-Aryan society as they tried to imitate the Aryas way of life, politics and religion. However, the Mlecchas did not completely assimilated nor absorbed Indo-Aryan customs as they practiced Vedic rituals along their own in their languages instead of Sanskrit something that was frowned upon by the Vedics but that helped them differentiate from the newcomers."
 mleccha_4:0 "Breakaway from Danda Niti"
 mleccha_4_desc:0 "As mlecchas did not completely subjected themselves to the traditions of the Indians, their politics were much less regulated by the Science of Politics or Danda Niti allowing for mleccha kings to act more despotically.

 mleccha_5:0 "Mleccha Bhasha"
 mleccha_5_desc:0 "The name mleccha comes from the Sanskrit onomatopeia for saying gibberish, as from the Sanskrit-speaking Aryas perspective the languages of the Mleccha people were nothing more than gibberish that could not be compared to their prestigious sanskrit as sanskrit contained all sounds for proper speech. These languages were considered to be a lower form of speech that should never to be spoken by an Arya and received the name of Mleccha-Bhasha or foreign language."

 kassite_4_desc:0 "The Kassite Kingdom was a network of provinces administered by appointed governors (Shandabakku) who ruled their respective lands from palaces that replaced the old temples as the main administrative centers of the State and that had a great deal of autonomy and priviliges. The governors themselves came from the kassite stock, either from the royal family or noble clans while the lower levels of the government structure like bureaucrats or scribes were completely formed by Babylonians so the administration was run in Akkadian."
 kassite_5:0 "Mantaining the Kassite traditions"
 kassite_5_desc:0 "In spite of the Kassite conquest of Babylonia and the kassite royal dynasty and kings absorbing much of Babylonian culture and tradition, the kassite people itself was not very affected by Babylonian cultural influence and retained at large their traditional clan and family structure very different from that of the Babylonians. This was mainly thanks to their self-segregation from the urban society and mantaining a semi-nomadic warrior lifestyle and inhabiting primarily the Zagros or the Babylonian wilderness, so a large number of kassites were still part of the lower echelons of society and even continued to serve as mercenaries to the Kassite state or other kingdoms."

 kassite_7:0 "Direct Palace administration and Functionary Simplification"
 kassite_7_desc:0 "Kassite administration was simpler than that of traditional akkadians with less functionaries, ranks and titles and with the almost complete removal of women from administrative and religious positions, something that helped the administration to be more efficient and cheaper as the kassites had no particular interest in purely ceremonial offices preceded from Babylonia. There was also more direct orders from Palaces to the Urban communities as the private sector consisting of families, artisan organizations and individuals were forced to work along State officials. And Land Tenancy of the King was in the beggining complete and extended to the whole country, over time land grants were given to members of the royal family temples and loyal state functionaries."

They helped to open up trade with the population that lived around the Black Sea as well as with Egypt, Cyrene (Libya), Corinth, and Chalcis. Among the colonies the Samians founded, most of them in the sixth century BCE, were Bisanthe, Perinthus, and Samothrace (northern Aegean Sea), Cydonia (Crete), Nagidos and Kelenderis (southern Anatolia), Dicaearchia (Italy), and Oasis Polis (Egypt). The trade caused them to become bitter rivals with Miletus."

 SAM_engineering_marvels_desc:0 "In the 6th century BC, Samos was ruled by the famous tyrant Polycrates. At that time Samos already was famous by Temple of Hera and Samos harbour, but he wanted to add more. During his reign, two working groups under the leadership of the engineer Eupalinos dug a tunnel through Mount Kastro to build an aqueduct to supply the ancient capital of Samos with fresh water, as this was of the utmost defensive importance. Eupalinos's tunnel is particularly notable because it is the second earliest tunnel in history to be dug from both ends in a methodical manner. With a length of over 1 km (0.6 mi), Eupalinos's subterranean aqueduct is today regarded as one of the masterpieces of ancient engineering. The aqueduct is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Pythagoreion."
 SAM_polycrates_legacy:0 "Polycrates Legacy"
 SAM_polycrates_legacy_desc:0 "Polycrates, son of Aeaces, was the tyrant of Samos from the 540s BC to 522 BC. He had a reputation as both a fierce warrior and an enlightened tyrant. Polycrates recruited an army of 1,000 archers and assembled a navy of 100 penteconters, which became the most powerful navy in the Greek world – Herodotus says that Polycrates was the first Greek ruler to understand the importance of sea power and Thucydides includes him in his list of thalassocracies in the Aegean. His main ally was Egypt, and together they defied Persian supremacy on sea. Herodotus says that he "raided everyone without any discrimination. For he said that a friend would be more appreciative if what was taken from him was returned than if it had not first been snatched away." Aideen Carty argues that the focus of this raiding was the acquisition of slaves whom he exported to Egypt to serve as mercenaries in Amasis' army"

At the end of the Peloponnesian War, Samos appears as one of the most loyal dependencies of Athens, serving as a base for the naval war against the Peloponnesians and as a temporary home of the Athenian democracy during the revolution of the Four Hundred at Athens (411 BC), and in the last stage of the war was rewarded with the Athenian franchise. This friendly attitude towards Athens was the result of a series of political revolutions, which ended in the establishment of a democracy."
