They helped to open up trade with the population that lived around the Black Sea as well as with Egypt, Cyrene (Libya), Corinth, and Chalcis. Among the colonies the Samians founded, most of them in the sixth century BC, were Bisanthe, Perinthus, and Samothrace (northern Aegean Sea), Cydonia (Crete), Nagidos and Kelenderis (southern Anatolia), Dicaearchia (Italy), and Oasis Polis (Egypt).

At that time Samos already was famous by Temple of Hera and Samos harbour, but he wanted to add more. During his reign, two working groups under the leadership of the engineer Eupalinos dug a tunnel through Mount Kastro to build an aqueduct to supply the ancient capital of Samos with fresh water, as this was of the utmost defensive importance. Eupalinos's tunnel is particularly notable because it is the second earliest tunnel in history to be dug from both ends in a methodical manner. With a length of over 1 km (0.6 mi), Eupalinos's subterranean aqueduct is today regarded as one of the masterpieces of ancient engineering. The aqueduct is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Pythagoreion."

 SAM_polycrates_legacy_desc:0 "Polycrates, son of Aeaces, was the tyrant of Samos from the 540s BC to 522 BC. He had a reputation as both a fierce warrior and an enlightened tyrant. Polycrates recruited an army of 1,000 archers and assembled a navy of 100 penteconters, which became the most powerful navy in the Greek world – Herodotus says that Polycrates was the first Greek ruler to understand the importance of sea power and Thucydides includes him in his list of thalassocracies in the Aegean. His main ally was Egypt, and together they defied Persian supremacy on sea. Herodotus says that he "raided everyone without any discrimination. For he said that a friend would be more appreciative if what was taken from him was returned than if it had not first been snatched away." Aideen Carty argues that the focus of this raiding was the acquisition of slaves whom he exported to Egypt to serve as mercenaries in Amasis' army"

This friendly attitude towards Athens was the result of a series of political revolutions, which ended in the establishment of a democracy."

 venetes_2:0 "Controlling the Trade"
 venetes_2_desc:0 "The Veneti had trading stations in Britain and regularly sailed to the island, and they charged customs and port dues on trade ships as they passed through the region. Strabo suggests that they were also using the terrestrial routes and rivers of Armorica to trade with Britain."
 venetes_3:0 "Thick Ships"
 venetes_3_desc:0 "The Veneti built their ships of oak with large transoms fixed by iron nails of a thumb's thickness. They navigated and powered their ships through the use of leather sails. This made their ships strong, sturdy and structurally sound, capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of the Atlantic. Roman galleys were at a serious disadvantage compared to the far thicker Veneti ships. The thickness of their ships meant they were resistant to ramming, whilst their greater height meant they could shower the Roman ships with projectiles, and even command the wooden turrets which Caesar had added to his bulwarks."
 venetes_4:0 "Largest Fleet in Armorica"

 venetes_6:0 "Island Citadels"
 venetes_6_desc:0 "The Veneti built their strongholds on the tips of coastal spits or promontories, where shoals make approaching the headlands by sea dangerous, an unusual position which sheltered them from sea-borne attack. Given the highly defensible nature of the Veneti strongholds, land attacks were frustrated by the incoming tide, and naval forces were left trapped on the rocks when the tide ebbed. Once the Veneti were threatened in one stronghold, they used their fleet to evacuate to another stronghold, obliging the enemy to repeat the siege elsewhere."

Their coinage turns up in hoards well outside their home territories, in some cases so widely distributed in the finds that the place of coinage is not secure. The iconography of their numismatics includes the motifs of heads with traditional Celtic torcs; a wolf with a star; a galloping horse; and the triskelion. Many coins show an eagle with the lunar crescent, with a serpent, or with a wheel with six or four spokes, or a pentagrammatic star, or beneath a hand holding a branch with berries, holly perhaps. The wheel with four spokes forms a cross within a circle, an almost universal image since Neolithic times. Sometimes the circle is a ring of granules."

 NEZ_5:0 "Anticavalry Hedges"

 NEZ_7:0 "'Heroes'"
 NEZ_7_desc:0 "In 57 BC at the battle of the Sabis, Nervii concealed themselves in the forests and attacked the approaching Roman column at the river. Their attack was so quick and unexpected that some of the Romans didn't have time to take the covers off their shields or even put on their helmets. The element of surprise briefly left the Romans exposed. However Caesar grabbed a shield, made his way to the front line, and quickly organised his forces; at the same time, the commander of the tenth legion, Titus Labienus, attacked the Nervian camp. The two legions who had been guarding the baggage train at the rear arrived and helped to turn the tide of the battle. Caesar says the Nervii were almost annihilated in the battle and is effusive in his tribute to their bravery, calling them 'heroes'."

 rhone_1:0 "Lumberjacks and Potters"
 rhone_1_desc:0 "Segusiavi were known as excellent lumberjacks, trading in oak wood that is transported by river from their territory to the Mediterranean Sea. Archeologists also claims they were excellent potters, though then did not knew ceramics forms of romans and greeks, and imported their ceramics too alongside producing their own. Archaeological evidence shows that the Ségusiaves manufactured ceramics (“Roanne” type painted bowls), and had weaving workshops. The manufacture of wine amphorae in the pottery workshops of Roanne very probably indicates local wine production from the 1st century BC. Blacksmithing and goldsmithing activities are also present in the main towns and oppidums."
 rhone_2:0 "Tin Trade Posts"
 rhone_2_desc:0 "At a later time Rhone river tribes oppidums would have been trading posts on the “tin route” and traded with the Phoenicians, tin coming from across the Channel (Cornwall) and transported from the Breton coasts to the Mediterranean world."
 rhone_3:0 "Defending Against Allobroges"
 rhone_3_desc:0 "Segusiave and Ambarri were early in confrontations with neighbouring tribes - like Allobroges, whom they managed to repel, and Arverni. Segusiavi were once part of Arvernian confederation, but left to become allies of Aedui after 121 BC, that marked start of principal conflict and embargos between them and Arverni."
 rhone_4:0 "Mastering River Trade"
 rhone_4_desc:0 "In addition, four overland trade routes, the Lyon-Saintes double route, the Lyon-Vichy route, the Feurs-Nimes route, and the Moingt-Roanne route, as well as three major river routes, the Loire, Saone, and Rhone, crossed their territory"
 rhone_5:0 "Local Horses"
 rhone_5_desc:0 "We may suppose that the Segusiavi, like the Aedui and Ambarri, were a horsemen people; Forez has long been a region known for its horses, its geography particularly well suited to this type of breeding. In addition, the local characteristics of precipitation, which are quite low, contrary to what one might think, made the region poor in grain crops until the 19th century, and therefore favor the emergence of other types of exploitation."
 rhone_6:0 "Principal Trade Bridge"
 rhone_6_desc:0 "In addition, numerous inland routes were going through tribes territory, suggesting that the country of the Segusiavi was part of an important axis of exchange in the Rhone valley between the Mediterranean world, inner Gaul and beyond. Until the end of independence, the geographical position of their territory, mainly in the south of the "border" with the Roman world in the 1st century BC (the northern outlet of the Rhône valley) and therefore probably already partially influenced by Roman culture, suggests that the Segusiavi and Ambarri chieftains were able to gain the support of a powerful Celtic Aedui confederation in order to maintain their independence while taking advantage of the brisk trade with the Mediterranean world."
 rhone_7:0 "Taking the Profits of Roman Gallia"
 rhone_7_desc:0 "Their relations with Rome before the conquest appear cordial, there is no formal evidence of any aggression on either side. The fraternal treaty mentioned by Caesar confirms the position of a people friendly to Rome. After the Roman conquest, the Segusiavi enjoyed a privileged position during Augustus' reorganization of Gaul, when Rome granted them the political status of Civitas Segusiavorum Libera, which seems to indicate that the Segusiavi were on good terms with the Roman conqueror, which was not the case for most of Gallic peoples."
