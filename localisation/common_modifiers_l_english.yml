 shrine_of_medaurus:0 "Shrine of Medaurus"
 shrine_of_medaurus_desc:0 "An Illyrian god named Medaurus is mentioned in a dedication from Lambaesis (Numidia) made by a Roman legatus native of the Illyrian city of Risinium (present-day Montenegro). The name is more scarcely attested on another inscription found in Risinium, engraved by the Peripolarchoi, the border guards of the city; and also in Santa Maria di Leuca, where Medaurus is the divine name given to a merchant ship. Portrayed as riding on horseback and carrying a lance, Medaurus was the protector deity of Risinium, with a monumental equestrian statue dominating the city from the acropolis. He was also possibly regarded as a war god among Illyrian soldiers fighting in the Roman legions along the limes, especially during the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 AD)"
 shrine_of_sylvanus:0 "Shrine of Sylvanus"
 shrine_of_sylvanus_desc:0 "The cult of Silvanus, the Roman tutelary deity of the wild, woods and fields, was one of the most popular ritual traditions in Dalmatia and Pannonia during the Roman period.The way he was portrayed in Dalmatia differed from the rest of the Roman Empire, with various elements common only with Pannonia. Silvanus was depicted with attributes generally related to Pan, such as goat legs, horns, syrinx, pedum, grapes or other fruits, and he was escorted by a goat and female companions (Diana and the Nymphs)."
 shrine_of_redon:0 "Shrine of Redon"
 shrine_of_redon_desc:0 "The name Redon appears on coins minted by the Illyrian city of Lissos, suggesting that he was worshipped as the guardian deity of the city, and probably as a sea god. The fact that Redon was always depicted on coins wearing a petasos demonstrates a connection with travelling and sailing, which led historians to the conclusion that Redon was the deity protector of travellers and sailors. Indeed, the inscriptions of Santa Maria di Leuca were carved by the crews of two Roman merchant ships manned by Illyrians.Inscriptions mentioning Redon were also found on coins from the Illyrian cities of Daorson and Scodra, and even in archaeological findings from Dyrrhachium after the establishment of a Roman colony there. His name keeps on being used in the Albanian Kepi i Rodonit ("Cape of Rodon"), a headland located near Durres which could be analysed as an Illyrian sanctuary dedicated to the god of the sailors in the past."

 shrine_of_andinus_desc:0 "Andinus is an Illyrian god worshipped among the Dardanians, in the Roman province of Moesia Superior.

 shrine_of_thana_and_vidasus:0 "Shrines of Thana and Vidasus"
 shrine_of_thana_and_vidasus_desc:0 "In the hot springs of Topusko (Pannonia Superior), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Thana and Vidasus, whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Vidasus is identified with Silvanus, and his name may derive from the PIE root *widhu- ("tree, forest"), with a possible cognate in the Norse god Vidarr, who is said to live amid long grass and brushwood. Thana, compared with the Roman goddess Diana, was the deity of forestry and hunting. Scholars have argued that Thana survived as Zana of Albanian mythology, and that she can be traced today in the image of "mother Yana" within Serbian folklore."
 shrine_of_liber:0 "Shrine of Liber"
 shrine_of_liber_desc:0 "In Dalmatia, the Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom Liber was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus and those of Terminus, the god protector of boundaries. His cult was more widespread in the Balkanic province than in Italy, with prominent centres of cult in Salona and Narona. On the islands of Brattia and Corcyra Nigra, Liber was venerated under the epithet Torcle(n)sis as a god of the wine press. Certainly due to a mixing of local traditions under Hellenistic influence, he was often associated with the Greek god of wine, fertility and religious ecstasy Dyonisus. In Tragurium was erected a statue of Liber-Dionysus-Bacchus, and a relief from Omis depicts him as an effeminate Dionysus wearing vine branches and holding a thyrsus. A feminine version named Libera was also discovered in inscriptions from Hvar, Bihac, Zenica, Zemun and Humac."
