All the following options will be capped by these percentages. \n\nCurrent lootable wealth (if 100% ratio): [From.SD_loot.GetValue], possible pops lost or expelled: [From.SD_total_lost.GetValue] tribal / [From.SD_c_lost.GetValue] commoners / [From.SD_u_lost.GetValue] uppers, enslaved [From.SD_total_slaves.GetValue] (from each pop type: [From.SD_t_slave.GetValue] / [From.SD_c_slave.GetValue] / [From.SD_u_slave.GetValue]). \nBesieging your rival's capital overrides these values, destroys absolutely everything.

The options are a great way of earning money and slaves, although obviously there will be negative consequences for the province, such as colateral damage in buildings and population loss; as well as relations damage with the owner. \nBy default, you will have the siege events happening in provinces with at least 10 development, it can be changed going to the 'Sieges and Slaves Options' in the Decisions tab."

 sieges.4.d:0 "Winning a siege of an enemy's city will once again fire an event do decide what to to. Each option will depend on how much it can be enforced: a simple regiment of 1.000 soldiers won't be enough to sack a big city! \nThere is now an §Mefficiency ratio§!: Army size £icon_manpower£, "Ferocity" or viciousness of the attackers £mil£ (base value is 5), and province's population ¤1 in thousands. Value capped at 100%. \nAs an example, if you are besieging a city of 15 development, to achieve 100% efficiency you'd need (X regiments) * 5 (ferocity) = 15*10 -> 30 thousand soldiers. \nEvery option below needs military power, obtains a sizable amount of §Oloot money§! (with the possibility of destroying buildings) and causes a given amount of §Rdevastation§! and §gpopulation lost§! or §Benslaved§!. \nEnslavement and population loss depends whether you have activated the Popgrowth mechanics or not. If so, the maximum amount of population lost will be those over 60%/40%/20% minimum of tribals, commoners and upper population respectively. Otherwise (no Popgrowth), it's 20%/40%/75% of the current population. With the population to be enslaved, substracting all those who resist or can't be used, it's shared between §g%lost§! and §B%enslaved§!  \nOptions are as follows: \n - Ask Tribute:     5£mil£  §O20%§! / §R  5%§! / §g-§!   \n - Sack the city:   20£mil£  §O60%§! / §R 30%§! / §g-%§!   \n - Enslave (soft):  20£mil£  §O 5%§! / §R 10%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Enslave (hard):  20£mil£  §O10%§! / §R 25%§! / §g20%§!-§B80%§!   \n - Destroy the city:  60£mil£ §O40%§! / §R 60%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Delenda Est X:   100£mil£  §O100%§! / §R100%§! / §g80%§!-§B20%§!   \n - Leave them be: nothing   \n In the future there will be an option to §GLiberate§! their population if these are of your core, culture or other conditions."

Although then we won't be able to use the foundations again...\n\n§BGameplay information§!\nYou can repair any building lost during a previous siege or an accident. Buildings will stay ruined for at most five years, until plants and erosion has turned the ruins too damaged to be used again. \nRepair cost is 75% of the original build cost, and the building will be operating right away. \nSelecting to build a certain type of buildings will still allow you to rebuild something else later on, as long as the five-year limit is not reached. \nThe option to clear the rubble to lower devastation will cost 5% of the original building's cost, and a small amount of £adm£ power.
