 vanillaevent_override.1.t:0 "Unhappiness Among the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName]"
 vanillaevent_override.1.d:0 "Differing opinions and interests over religious and secular matters between our government and the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName] have spilled over and become a significant source of conflict. The [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName] are now making demands for changes in policy, failing which they will withdraw their support for the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]."
 vanillaevent_override.2.t:0 "Cessation of Church Functions"
 vanillaevent_override.2.d:1 "Several members of the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] have come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] with a proposal. Desperate for more lands and titles, they look with envy towards the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName], who own considerable land. They ask that we transfer church land to them in return for a large cash contribution to the [Root.GetStateForm]'s efforts. Of course, in the long term, we'd lose out on tax revenues from church lands in return for this short-term boost in revenue."
 vanillaevent_override.3.t:1 "The [Root.GetMerchantsOrFallbackName] Request Privileges"
 vanillaevent_override.3.d:1 "The [Root.GetMerchantsOrFallbackName] have grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government. Their only route into power is to marry into poor but well-titled noble families, or to pry open positions in government circles by demanding greater privileges from the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]."
 vanillaevent_override.4.d:1 "One of the local [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] in [uppity_peasants_province.GetName] has so upset and mistreated his subjects that a delegation of peasants has come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] to ask for redress. Agreeing to this would be popular with the peasantry but would be seen as an infringement on their authority by the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName]."
 vanillaevent_override.5.a:0 "Let them complain!"
 vanillaevent_override.6.t:0 "Priests condemns a philosopher as heretic!"
 vanillaevent_override.6.d:0 "A prominent philosopher is forwarding new claims that contradict religious truths. The priests demands that he be stopped and turned over for punishment. Either way, this will cause great turmoil in the realm."
 vanillaevent_override.6.a:0 "Support Priests"
 vanillaevent_override.7.t:0 "New Trade Research is Blasphemous"
 vanillaevent_override.7.d:0 "We have had complaints from several dignitaries in our country that the new practices of our merchants are clearly blasphemous, and that we should put a stop to them."
 vanillaevent_override.8.t:0 "Tensions between [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] and [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName]"
 vanillaevent_override.8.d:0 "In our nation two castes hold great power: the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] and the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName]. However, they do not always get along. Recently, a noble in [rebel_province.GetName] and the local temple of his fief began bickering about who owns a rather large piece of land.\n\nThese days, the royal court is swamped with people yammering about divine right - the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] claiming their divine right to rule the land and the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName] asserting their position as the representatives of the gods on Earth. The whole situation is growing rather unstable, with the noble in question inciting the other nobles against the [Root.GetPriesthoodOrFallbackName] and questioning their right to hold any sort of temporal property. The priest of the temple has brought in allies on his side, who in turn threatens to go straight to the High Priest should you decide to side with the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName]. Now, what shall we do, my liege?"
 vanillaevent_override.8.a:0 "Enforce the noble's claim"
 vanillaevent_override.8.b:0 "Surely we do not wish to anger the priests."
 vanillaevent_override.9.t:0 "A New Champion"
 vanillaevent_override.9.d:0 "During a recent melee tournament, a commoner surprised all in attendance by besting everyone who faced him until he was declared the champion. Now we face the awkward decision of what to do with him."
 vanillaevent_override.10.d:1 "Recently, a young female poet called [Root.female_troubadour.GetName] who has won fame across the region for her unconventional music was invited to perform at your court. The sight of her costume prompted the entire room to gasp. Her poems had countless instances of thinly-disguised innuendo and references to unconventional sex acts - at one point the head priest turned scarlet and stormed out of the room. The performance concluded, all eyes turn to you to hear your response."
 vanillaevent_override.11.d:0 "Despite our promises to maintain sound monetary policies, we have debased our currency. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ money is now being dumped in banks and merchant houses around the world, and the value of it is sinking faster than a scurvy-ridden, rat-infested galley in a typhoon."
 vanillaevent_override.12.d:0 "Heavy storms have hit our ceramic workshops in [chinaware_province.GetName]. It will take years until they have recovered to full productivity."

 forced_migration.1.t:0 "A New Homeland"
 forced_migration.1.d:0 "Forced to flee from our home by the invading hordes of the [From.GetAdjective], we have decided than instead of staying and let ourselves be subjugated we rather prefer to venture in to the world beyond and claim this new land as ours and build a new country in it. The only problem toward this objective is that this land is property of the already stablished people of [newhome_original_owner.GetAdjective], thus depending on their own situation lies the question of how we ought to take the course of our new country, if we shall invade them if they are weak or to offer our tribute if they are strong and in that case hope they don't decide to turn against us."

 forced_migration.3.d:0 "One of our states has been recently fallen into the control of a band of fleeing [From.GetName] migrants as their original homeland has been conquered from them, though they seem to recognize our power as they have sent an embassy saying that they are in the disposition of paying tribute, their greatest desire is to live in our rightful land. Ceding to the migrants land that we own would damage our prestige, but they are still a numerous horde so if our army is not prepared we might as well accept their proposal."

 lydia.3.a:0 "Lydia will be the only empire here."
 lydia.4.t:0 "Phrygian local kings"
 lydia.4.d:0 "With the collapse of phrygian kingdom lydians conquered lands it once help. However, not all lands were held by lydians directly. In some places, like Pteria, rebuild forts were ruled by petty kings that were "commanders" of local forces or rulers of lands beyond river Halys."
 lydia.4.a:0 "Led this petty wanakts rule the borderlands for us."
 lydia.5.t:0 "Lydia betrays Caria"
 lydia.5.d:0 "At some point in the later years of his reign, Alyattes conducted a military campaign in Caria, although the reason for this intervention is yet unknown. Before that, Carian cities and princes were allies of Lydia, so either Lydia ran out of targets for conquest, or Caria bethrayed Lydia in some way. Alyattes's son Croesus, future king, as current governor of Adramyttium, had to provide his father with Ionian Greek mercenaries for this war."
 lydia.5.a:0 "Anatolia will be either Lydia, or depopulated."

 japan.1.d:0 "The Yayoi period of Japan it's theorized to have started by the first millenium BC, as can be noted from the cultural and technological changes, most importantly the introduction of wet rice agriculture, livestock and bronze. It is known that these changes were introduced in Japan by a knew population named the Yayoi who soon came to replace or assimilate the hunter-gatherer Jomon. Due to the lack of any written sources as the first text concerning Japan, the Wajinden, comes from the 3rd century BC, it is unknown what is the exact origin of the Yayoi; so various hypothesis have arise in academia with a popular one being that the Yayoi came from the Korean peninsula as it is also hypothesized that the original inhabitants of it's southern part were people who spoke a form of proto-japonic, who were forced to migrate in to Kyushu (were the oldest yayoi artifacts are) due to the expansion of the koreanic people."

The Yayoi would slowly push the Jomon out of all Japan, however their descendants/ relatives live on today as the Ainu on Hokkaido.\n\n§RWa culture will spread across Japan over time, however, you'll get the option to resist expansion in provinces that are part of your tribal land (if you own the Conquest of Paradise DLC). You may also choose to let them settle, instead - if you do so more than 3 times, you'll additionally get a decision to become Japonic yourself, after which you can form Wa if you own all of Kyushu. If you don't own Conquest of Paradise, you'll instead get events to prevent any Jomon provinces from becoming Wa. Refusing 3 or more times will likewise unlock the decision to become Japonic."

 maeotian.1.d:0 "The Sindi were a tribe of the Maeotians, the ancient circassians, that lived in the Taman peninsula. Due to their proximity to the greek colonies that were setup in Cimmeria, such as Panticapaeum or Myrmekion, and their not so nomadic lifestyle, the Sindi quickly became under the mantle of hellenic influence, becoming very accepting of the greeks and even hellenizing early on, adopting the greek script and greek traditions, most of this was oversaw by their ruler Hekataios who himself was a great friend of the kings of Panticapaeum and benefactor of greek culture."

Because of this she fled back to the Iaxamatae where she used her charisma and military excellence to unite the Maeotians against Bosporus, being succesful in this endeavor as the Iaxamatae became the most powerful tribe and they would mantain independence from Bosporus until the Sarmatian expansions.\nBecause of her warrior spirit and military power she would be considered by the people of the ancient world as the true case of an Amazon."

It is thus in this context that the son of a chieftain of the Parni, Arsaces (in parthian; Arshak) who was an experienced military leader, rises to power and seizes several more territory to the west of his domain, eventually in 250 BC proclaiming himself as king and thus establishing the Arsacid dynasty that would go on to rule Iran."

Among the groups of these tribes there were the Bruttians who were the most warlike of the lucanians and were the main factor over the lucanian expansion towards south Italy, but as they grew stronger they became more dissatisfied with the Lucanian government in general, to the point where they started to become organized as groups of rebels in southern Lucania (the name Bruttii itself means rebel in the Oscan language), there they couldn't be controlled by the rest of the Lucanians and so they splitted off from them to form their own nation."

The conquest of the Bruttians was quick as the oenotrians were exhausted due to the decades of conflict with the greek colonies, having being subdue by the bruttians, they quickly assimilated in to the tribe, abandoning their old customs and taking that of the conquerors.

 scythian.1.d:0 "By the end of the 6th Century BC huge changes occured to the situation of the Pontic Steppe, most importantly an increase in population led by an apparent migration westward of new groups of Iranian peoples, concentration of social power and a new found hostility of the already existing Scythian tribes that lived there towards foreigners, the latter of the events is possibly a result of the increasing greek pressence in the steppe as well as other iranian groups attempts at subjugating the so called 'Overseas Scythians' (such as the Achaemenid Empire).\nThe results of these changes was an organization of the scythian tribes and a consolidation of power in to more increasingly strong Kings and nobility as can be noted from a stark increase in funerary monuments. From this new found manpower and organization the Scythians would then go on to conduct military campaigns, raids and expansion towards their North and West, specially against non-nomadic peoples as they invaded from Dacia to Thrace and their steppe forest neighbours."

 scythian.4.t:0 "New connections between Scythians and Greeks"
 scythian.4.d:0 "During the 7th century BC and the early 6th century BC there was a huge trading and political connection between the Scythians of the Eurasian Steppe and the peoples and countries of the Middle East (Mesopotamia, the Caucasus and Iran) as it can be evidenced by the material findings of middle eastern goods being exported to the noble elites of the steppe, the popularity of middle eastern craftsmen in Scythia and a huge artistic and ritual influence from this region to the Steppe.\nIt's possible that this close relationship between the Middle East and Steppe was the result of groups from the latter region (Cimmerians or Ishkuza) conquering and inhabiting the region but as soon as the kingdom of the Scythians in the Caucasus collapsed as a result of Mede and Babylonian expansion, there was a sharp decline in trading and cultural influences between the regions with most trading then shifting west.\nWhat happened then was that the greeks started to colonize in larger quantities the coasts of the Pontic Steppe by around the same time and thus the Scythians shifted to rather trade with them than with the iranian oppressors of the Middle East, which in turn caused that the society of the Scythians would start to become more and more hellenic rather than middle eastern, something that can be noted in changes to their artistic style and who were their main trading partners."

The crisis was so bad that the construction of great funerary monuments which were common in the previous times of prosperity stopped for almost a century and the scythians were left so weakened that their culture was replaced in almost all of the steppe with only a few remnants and their activity was greatly reduced almost like a little dark age in scythian culture."

This region was then known as Lesser Scythia or Scythia Minor as here a new scythian kingdom was established by the migrants which contrary to their past nomadic life, was heavily hellenized.\n\nWe scythians have formed a large country and are under the possession of many pasture lands, one of these being the rich floodplains to the south of the Ister river which allure many fellow scythians to move there and form new communities, however, due to the pressence of other hostile tribes the migrants have moved in waves acting almost independently from us, it is possible that if we continue to allow for the scythians to move there they might form an independent country but the migrant leaders assure us that the country that they'll settle will continue to be in our possession and only have wishes of some autonomy as we confer to other people."

One of his most famous achievements was at the outbreak of the Second Punic War, when he marched an army which included elephants from Iberia over the Pyrenees and the Alps into Italy. In his first few years in Italy, he won three dramatic victories—Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae, in which he distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and to play the battle to his strengths and the enemy's weaknesses—and won over many allies of Rome. Hannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years, but a Roman counter-invasion of North Africa forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama. Scipio had studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own, and finally defeated Rome's nemesis at Zama, having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula."

After the overthrow of Melanchros in 612 BC by the conspirators Pittacus, Kyris and Antimanides, Myrsil returned from exile. \nIn 610 BC he was able to arrange a conspiracy, seizing power. In 607/606 BC Myrsilos led an active war against Athens for the city of Sigeion in Troad. He entrusted the army to Pittacus, who won the victory in duel with athenian commander. After he revealed conspiracy of another Pittacus in 604 BC, he banished Kyris, Antimanides and their brother Alcaeus from Mytilene to Pyrrha. Their property was confiscated for the benefit of the demos. There are separate references to attempts by Pittacus and his allies to overthrow Myrsil's power, but they all were in vain. It is known that Myrsilus had wide support in Mytilene. Perhaps due to a more flexible policy towards the aristocrats and other layers of society, as well as due to the alliance with the Lydian king Aliatt II. Myrsilos either died between 600 BC and 596 BC, or, according to different version, Myrsilos was overthrown in 597 BC and died in 596 BC in exile. After that, Pittacus took over power in Mytilene in a alliance with Alcaeus and Antimanides."

 mytilene.2.t:0 "Pittacus of Mytilene"
 mytilene.2.d:0 "Pittacus of Mytilene is an ancient Greek sage, legislator, one of the "seven sages". \nPittacus was a native of Mytilene and son of Hyrradius.He joined the noble families, having married a representative of the Penthilidae royal family. He became a Mytilenaean general who, with his army, was victorious in the battle against the Athenians and their commander Phrynon. \nTogether with Alcaeus and his brothers, Pittacus freed his native city from the tyrant Melancher. Soon, other contenders for power appeared, and Alcaeus was expelled. Meanwhile, the unrest continued in the city, as a result of which another tyrant, Myrsilos, was overthrown, and Mytilene citizens appointed Pittacus as esymnet, a mediator. Some scholars believe that Pittacus was even proclaimed king, and usually refer to the ancient "Song of the Miller". However, the song only says that he "reigned", i.e. had power over the city. After ten years of reign, he resigned his position and the city and constitution were brought into good order.\nThe system introduced by Pittacus was considered by contemporaries to be almost ideal, and the laws established by him, carved on wooden boards for general reference, were in effect a century later, even after the establishment of Persian power on Lesbos. However, it is not known exactly what the "Pittacus system" was. Only mentions of the fact that Pittacus strove to provide the needy with land, forced officials to listen to the will of the people's assembly, limited the extravagance of wealthy citizens and the arbitrariness of parents have survived. Sources (at least those quite friendly to Pittacus) emphasize Esymnet's caution and moderation. Therefore, researchers believe that he convinced the Mytilene aristocracy to share power with the top of the demos, to which, in fact, Pittacus himself belonged. Pittacus instituted a law stating that crimes committed in drunkenness should be punished twofold; that was directed predominantly against the aristocrats, who were more often guilty of drunk and violent behaviour. As such, it was greatly appreciated by the common people."

In consequence of this victory, the Mytilenaeans held Pittacus in the greatest honour and presented the supreme power into his hands. After ten years of reign, he resigned his position and the city and constitution were brought into good order. \nWhen the Athenians were about to attack Sigeion, Pittacus challenged their general to a single combat, with the understanding that the result should decide the war, and much bloodshed be thereby avoided. The challenge was accepted, and he killed his enemy with a broad sword. Polyaenus in his Stratagems wrote that Pittacus had secretly concealed a net under his shield. He caught Phrynon with the net, dragged him down and killed him. According to Polyaenus, this stratagem of Pittacus gave rise to the use of nets in duels between gladiators."

The dispute was referred to the Spartans, who eventually awarded possession of the island to Athens on the strength of the case that Solon put to them. Plutarch professes admiration of Solon's elegy. The same poem was said by Diogenes Laërtius to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote.\n\nLet us go to Salamis to fight for the island\nWe desire, and drive away from our bitter shame!"

 athenai.15.d:0 "In 594 BC, Solon, premier archon at the time, issued reforms that defined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function - Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property, Solon reshaped the social framework of the city-state. Under these reforms, a council of 400 members (with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) called the Boule ran daily affairs and set the political agenda. The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but subsequently carried on the role of "guardianship of the laws". Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an ecclesia or Assembly, which was open to all male citizens, regardless of social class. The Alcmaeonids were also allowed back into the city, during the archonship of Solon. Eventually the moderate reforms of Solon, improving the lot of the poor but firmly entrenching the aristocracy in power, gave Athens some stability."

 athenai.17.d:0 "Originally, Pisistratus became known as an Athenian general who captured the port of Nisaea (or Nisaia) in the nearby city-state of Megara in approximately 565 BC. This victory opened up the unofficial trade blockage that had been contributing to food shortages in Athens during the previous several decades. In the subsequent years after Solon and his departure from Athens, Aristotle reports that the city of Athens was still very divided and in turmoil, with many secondary sources noting the development of three distinct political factions competing for control of Athens and its government. According to Aristotle, these groups were partitioned in both a geographic (as documented below) and economic sense. The first two factions, based on the plains and the coast, appeared to exist prior to the formation of the third faction. The third group, referred to as men of the Highlands (or Hill), had various motives to align with Pisistratus, including those men in poverty, recent immigrants who feared loss of citizenship, and lenders who were denied the ability to collect their debts. Names of the competing factions differ according to the accessed source, with some references offering details on each group's composition while others do not.\n\n Pedieis or Pediakoi - the population that resided on the plains, led by Lycurgus. These landowners produced grain, giving them leverage during the food shortage.\n\n Paralioi or Paraloi - the population living along the coast, led by Megacles, an Alcmaeonid. The Paralioi party was not as strong as the Pedieis, primarily because they could not produce grain, like the plainsmen. With the Megareans patrolling the sea, much of Athens' import/export power was limited. \n\nHyperakrioi - not previously represented by the first two factions or parties listed above, dwelled primarily in the hills and were by far the poorest of the Athenian population. Their only production was barter in items like honey and wool. Pisistratus organised them into a third faction, the Hyperakrioi, or hill dwellers. This party grossly outnumbered the other two parties combined and was his power base."

 athenai.18.d:0 "His role in the Megarian conflict gained Pisistratus popularity in Athens, but he did not have the political clout to seize power. Around the year 561 BC, Herodotus writes how Pisistratus intentionally wounded himself and his mules, asking the Athenian people to provide bodyguards for protection and reminding them of his prior accomplishments, including the port capture of Nisiai. \nPisistratus had driven his chariot into the agora or marketplace of Athens, claiming he had been wounded by his enemies outside of town, and thus, the people of Athens selected some of their men to function as a bodyguard, armed with clubs rather than spears, for him. Previously, he had assumed control of the Hyperakrioi, which was not an aristocratic group like the other two Athens factions, by promoting his democratic program and securing a mutual agreement with the members or demos of the faction. By obtaining support from this vast number of the poorer population and receiving the protection of bodyguards, he was able to overrun and seize the Acropolis as well as grasp the reins of the government. \n\nThe Athenians were open to a tyranny similar to that under Solon, who previously had been offered the tyranny of Athens but declined, and in the early part of the Archaic Age, the rivalries among the aristocratic clans was fierce, making a single-ruler tyranny an attractive option, with the promise of possible stability and internal peace, and Pisistratus' ruse won him further prominence.\n\n With the Acropolis in his possession and with the support of his bodyguard, he declared himself tyrant"

His first foray into power started in the year 561 and lasted about five years. His first ouster from office was circa 556/555 BC after the other two factions, the Plains people led by Lycurgus and the Coastal people led by Megacles, normally at odds with each other, joined forces and removed him from power. Different sources provide conflicting or unspecified time intervals for the periods of Pisistratus' reign. For example, Herodotus writes that Megacles' and Lycurgus' followers combined after a short time to expel Pisistratus from power. Aristotle comments that Pisistratus was forced out during the year of the archonship of Hegesias, five years after he originally assumed his first tyranny in Athens."

Soon after, in the year 556 BC or so, Megacles invited Pisistratus back for a return to power upon the condition Pisistratus marry Megacles' daughter. \nAccording to Herodotus, the two men concocted a creative method to rally the people of Athens back to Pisistratus' side. A tall, almost six foot woman, Phye, from the deme or rural village of Paiania was selected to pose as the goddess Athena, by being dressed in full armour, riding in a chariot, and being counselled on how to portray the goddess. Heralds were sent ahead to announce that Athena herself was bringing Pisistratus back to her acropolis and that she exalted him above all other men. Word travelled fast to the people throughout the villages and even to those in the city believing that Phye was the goddess Athena and consequently, Pisistratus was welcomed back by the awestruck Athenians."

Apparently, Pisistratus was unwilling to compromise the political futures of his sons, Hipparchus and Hippias. Furious, Megacles broke off this short-lived alliance with Pisistratus and drove him into exile for a second time, with the help of Pisistratus' enemies. During the length of his exile lasting approximately ten years, Pisistratus relocated to Rhaicelus or Rhaecelus, notable for its good agricultural base, in the Strymon river region of northern Greece, and eventually settled in the vicinity of Mount Pangaeus or Pangaion, accumulating wealth from the gold and silver mines located nearby. Financed by the mining money, he hired mercenary soldiers and bolstered with the support of allies such as the Thebans and the affluent Lygdamis of the island Naxos, he looked southward for a return to power."

The Athenians mustered a force in opposition and met Pisistratus' forces at Pallene. Providing some background details, Herodotus comments that just before the battle commences a seer gave Pisistratus a prophecy that the net has been cast and the tuna will swarm through. With the prophecy both welcomed and understood by Pisistratus, his troops advanced and attacked the Athenian forces who were resting after lunch, easily routing them. While the Athenians retreated and in order to prevent them from reforming their forces, Pisistratus directed his sons to ride after the routed Athenians and announce that they should return home, retaining no anxiety or fear from the situation at hand. Historically, with those instructions, the Athenians complied and Pisistratus was able to return to rule Athens for a third time as tyrant, with his reign lasting from 546 BC till his death in 528 or 527 BC."

Pisistratus, likewise, had a two pronged approach - improve and modify agricultural production as well as expand commerce. In terms of agriculture, Solon had previously initiated a focus on the growth and cultivation of olives, which were better suited to the Athenian climate, as a cash crop. Pisistratus reintroduced a focus on olive production and in conjunction, he allocated funds to help the peasants outside the city of Athens, who were a key constituent bloc of his party, the Hyperakrioi, to obtain land as well as purchase tools and farm equipment. The small farmer loans were funded in large part by an assessment or tax on agricultural production, a rare documented example of an Athenian direct tax, at a rate of ten percent according to Aristotle. A secondary source reports that the tax was closer to five percent. Consequently, providing loans and monies to the rural residents surrounding Athens allowed them to continue working in the fields and to perhaps have them be uninterested in the politics of the city-state."

Control of the temple of Demeter, located in Eleusis and honouring the goddesses Demeter and Persephone, was also accomplished by Pisistratus and as a result, the floor plan of a great hall, the Telesterion, was redesigned so a much larger building (27m by 30m) could be built on site, with completion during the last few years of Pisistratus' reign or during the time of his sons' rule.

A permanent copying of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey was commissioned by Pisistratus and he also increased the visibility of the Panathenaic festival, whose origins date from earlier in the 6th century and was celebrated to a large degree every four years, with scaled-down versions of the festival every year. Due to the expansion of the Panathenaic festival, Athena became the most revered goddess of Athens, in essence the patron god of the city-state, and the end of the festival would see a parade travelling to Athena's temple at the Acropolis, featuring a robe for the deity made by young Athenian women. Recitations of Homeric poems and athletic competitions became part of the festivities and prizes were given to the winners. The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. \nNew festivals were inaugurated such as the greater and lesser Dionysia, which honoured Dionysus, the god of wine and pleasure, and vase paintings of that period highlighted drinking and exuberant celebratory scenes. At the Dionysia festival, prizes were granted for the singing of dithyrambs and by the year 534 BC approximately, tragedy plays were an annual competition occurrence. Control of the temple of Demeter, located in Eleusis and honouring the goddesses Demeter and Persephone, was also accomplished by Pisistratus and as a result, the floor plan of a great hall, the Telesterion, was redesigned so a much larger building (27m by 30m) could be built on site, with completion during the last few years of Pisistratus' reign or during the time of his sons' rule. Completely made of stone, the Telesterion had marble upper works, a Doric style portico, and tiles. The Greater Mysteries festival at Eleusis was an annual event held in the fall of each year, and was a Pan-Hellenic cult event for people both inside and outside of the Attica region.

He secured his position by exiling potential rivals and extended his dominance over neighbouring islands such as Paros. Lygdamis contributed a force of mercenaries to aid his ally Polycrates, the powerful tyrant of Samos, in his campaigns against Miletus and Mytilene. \nLygdamis had an ambitious building program and in 530 BC he began work on a huge Temple of Apollo which was never completed.

In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, he changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations, and which formed the basis of the upper-class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their deme), which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure. \nHe also established sortition - the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity. In addition, he reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouleutic oath, 'To advise according to the laws what was best for the people'.\nCleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism (first used in 487 BC), whereby a vote by at least 6,000 citizens would exile a citizen for ten years. Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized."

This dependence on foreign soldiers has raised concerns among the native Egyptian populace, who feel sidelined and undervalued in their own homeland.\nFurthermore, the Pharaoh's inclination to speak Greek within his court has exacerbated the situation. This preference for the Greek language over the native Egyptian tongue is seen as a blatant disregard for Egyptian culture and traditions. Such actions have alienated many Egyptians, fostering a sense of discontent and mistrust towards his leadership. The combination of military failures, reliance on foreign mercenaries, and cultural insensitivity has created a fraught and tense atmosphere in the kingdom."

This neglect came to a head with the mutiny of soldiers stationed at the strategically crucial Aswan (Swenett) garrison on south borders.\nFor years, these border guards, who were of Libyan or mixed local origin, had been denied proper payment and faced deteriorating conditions. Their grievances, long ignored, finally reached a boiling point. Feeling abandoned and underappreciated, the soldiers decided to take drastic action. They abandoned their posts at the forts, leaving a critical part of Egypt's defense vulnerable.\nSeeking refuge and a more promising future, the mutinous soldiers escaped to the Kingdom of Kush. Under the rule of the Kushite king, they hoped to find better treatment and compensation. This desertion not only weakened Egypt's southern defenses but also underscored the growing dissatisfaction and instability within the Pharaoh's military ranks.\nThe mutiny highlighted the broader issues of mismanagement and neglect that plagued the Pharaoh's reign, further eroding his authority and the confidence of his subjects."

 egypt.22.t:0 "Kyrene Civil War"
 egypt.22.d:0 "When Battus II of Cyrene died, his son Arcesilaus II ascended the throne, along with his queen, Eryxo. Arcesilaus appointed Learchus as his advisor. Herodotus states that Learchus was his brother, but Plutarch contradicts him in saying that Learchus was an ill-mannered and vicious friend. A further contradiction is presented in that Herodotus speaks of the activities of Learchus as the activities of the "brothers of Arcesilaus" and does not mention Learchus by name until he is identified as the regicide of Arcesilaus. Arcesilaus followed the counsels of Learchus and became increasingly tyrannical. It is in this manner that Arcesilaus gained the epithet "the Oppressor." During this time, Learchus was secretly plotting to overthrow Arcesilaus and become Cyrenaica's new king, and he manipulated Arcesilaus into ordering the banishment or death of many Cyrenaean nobles.\n\nWhen Arcesilaus found out about Learchus plotting, they quarrelled over the kingship and Learchus falsely blamed all misdoing on the king. Arcesilaus then ordered Learchus and his supporters to be exiled from Cyrenaica. \nLearchus and his supporters left the city of Cyrene and created their own settlement called Barca. \nDuring the construction of Barca, Learchus was able to persuade local Libyans to withdraw their allegiance from Cyrene and encourage them to come with him and to declare war on Arcesilaus. The Libyans were already disgruntled at having been cut off from a large part of their lands. Thus, Learchus gained an army...and now is ready to strike us!"

 egypt.23.t:0 "Amasis Political Course"
 egypt.23.d:0 "Despite winning civil war as antigreek candidate, Amasis brought Egypt into closer contact with Greece than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of Lower Egypt especially with splendid monolithic shrines and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains). For example, a shrine built by him was excavated at Tell Nebesha.\n\nAmasis assigned the commercial colony of Naucratis on the Canopic branch of the Nile to the Greeks, and when the temple of Delphi was burnt, he contributed 1,000 talents to the rebuilding. \nHe also married a Greek princess named Ladice daughter of King Battus III and made alliances with Polycrates of Samos and Croesus of Lydia.\n\nHis kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the First Cataract, but to this he added Cyprus, and his influence was great in Cyrene, Libya.\nUnder Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. \nHerodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that- 'It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II (Amasis) that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men, and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000.'"

Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life, and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature."

 rome.12.t:0 "Recruitment Of Landless Romans"
 rome.12.d:0 "Gaius Marius, as part of the Marian Reforms of 107 BC, allowed these non-land-owning Romans to enlist in the Roman legions. For the first time, men no longer had to own property to fight for Rome. Because these men had no property, they became the clients of their generals and veterans looked to them for land or monies after demobilization. Since the reforms did not include a permanent demobilization method divorced from army commanders, soldiers became closely linked to their generals for the process of rewarding them for service on demobilization. The lack of a permanent demobilization process run by the government in Marius' military reform would help facilitate the demise of the Roman Republic."

 rome.13.t:0 "The Standing Army"
 rome.13.d:0 "The second important reform implemented by Marius was the formation of a standing army. Marius was able to standardize training and equipment throughout the Roman legions. Drilling and training took place all year round, even in times of peace, not just when war threatened. \n\nMarius organized the legions as follows. The total number of men in a full strength legion was about 6,000, with 4,800 actual soldiers. The rest were classified as non-combatants. The internal organization of a legion consisted of 10 cohorts of 6 centuries each. The century consisted of 100 men, 80 legionaries and 20 non-combatants. However, the first cohort was irregular and consisted of 5 double strength centuries (containing 160 men). Each century was divided again into 10 contubernia led by a decanus. The contubernium contained 8 legionaries and 2 non-combatant servants who tented and messed together. The century fought as a unit, marched as a unit and camped as a unit. The century carried with it all the arms and accoutrements required to feed and maintain it as a fighting unit. Each man was responsible for carrying his own supplies, weapons and several days' worth of rations. That change drastically reduced the size of the baggage train required as support and made the army much more mobile. Between 2 and 6 legions clubbed together constituted an army. The legions were kept in peak physical condition and discipline by constant training, one of the best in the ancient world."

When the city fell, Olympias was killed, and Kassandros had Alexander IV and Roxanne confined at Amphipolis. Kassandros associated himself with the Argead dynasty by marrying Alexander’s half-sister, Thessalonica, and he had Alexander IV and Roxanne poisoned in either 310 BC or the following year. Killing Alexander's wife and child became a bloody stain on Kassandros reputation, an evil deed that shocked the whole Hellenic world. After death of Roxanne and Alexander IV there were no direct descendants of Alexander who could rightfully lay claim to the throne of Macedon.

Though elements of Koine Greek took shape in Classical Greece, the post-Classical period of Greek is defined as beginning with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, when cultures under Greek sway in turn began to influence the language.

Under the leadership of Macedon, their newly formed common variety was spoken from the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt to the Seleucid Empire of Mesopotamia. It replaced existing ancient Greek dialects with an everyday form that people anywhere could understand. Though elements of Koine Greek took shape in Classical Greece, the post-Classical period of Greek is defined as beginning with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, when cultures under Greek sway in turn began to influence the language. Being too far away from mainland Greece, former colonies or enclaves of greek culture have started to diverge and form a culture of their own."

 religion_indian.9.d:0 "Siddhartha Gautama was born into a noble family in northern India. The prince reached his late 20s with little experience of the world outside the walls of his opulent palaces, but one day he ventured out beyond the palace walls and was quickly confronted with the realities of human frailty. At age 29, he left his kingdom, wife and son to lead an ascetic life, and determine a way to relieve the universal suffering that he now understood to be one of the defining traits of humanity. For the next six years, Siddhartha lived an ascetic life and partook in its practices, studying and meditating using the words of various religious teachers as his guide. One night, Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree, vowing to not get up until the truths he sought came to him, and he meditated until the sun came up the next day. He remained there for several days. And soon a picture began to form in his mind of all that occurred in the universe, and Siddhartha finally saw the answer to the questions of suffering that he had been seeking for so many years. In that moment of pure enlightenment, Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha."

 rome.35.d:0 "The Marian reforms addressed issues noticed in the army of the late Republic, the fact that a large amount of the population; landless Romans, could not be enlisted as they had no land or property to be counted in a census. Instead, they would be counted by the head, and given arms and armour by the state since they would not be wealthy enough to afford their own arms. This allowed a part of the population to begin as career soliders, allowing the Republic to now field a professional standing army with semi-standardized equipment and insentive to fight harder, as they could gain spoils from the battlefields they fought. The Legions were also reorganized from Maniples into Cohorts, making one Legion consist of ten Cohorts with six Centuries in each, forming one Legion of 4800. With each Centuria marching, fighting, and camping as a single unit of a larger army, it allowed them to maintain cohesion and discipline, ensuring the Roman army was one of the best in the Mediterranean."

 rome.36.t:0 "Military reforms of the Roman Empire"
 rome.36.d:0 "Many parts of the military were reorganized and further advanced upon the ascendence of the Empire and its wars, especially a need to remove the ability of potential usurpers enlisting 'emergency' armies that had been previously decommissioned into their ranks. To remove the necessity of these, the army's total size was increased to remove dependence on them. Along with that, gradual changes came to the composition of the Legions, becoming much less reliant on Italic manpower. Although only born Romans were allowed to join the military, some non-Romans were seemingly granted semi-official citizenship in exchange for enlisting into the army. This mixing of Roman and non-Romans in the military commonly led to the non-Romans 'romanizing' themselves voluntarily, rather than 'barbarizing' the legions. This much needed boost to manpower would allow the Romans to keep their lands secure, allowing the Pax Romana to go on for as long as it had."

The Academy persisted throughout the Hellenistic period as a skeptical school, until coming to an end after the death of Philo of Larissa in 83 BC. Although philosophers continued to teach Plato's philosophy in Athens throughout the Roman era, it was not until 410 AD that a revived Academy was established as a center for Neoplatonism, persisting until 529 AD when it was finally closed by Justinian I. The Platonic Academy has been cited by historians as the first higher learning institution in the Western world."

Philetaerus served Lysimachus until 282 BC, when perhaps because of conflicts involving the court intrigues of Arsinoë, Lysimachus' third wife, Philetaerus deserted Lysimachus, offering himself and the important fortress of Pergamon, along with its treasury to Seleucus, who subsequently defeated and killed Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC.

 rome.17.t:0 "Servius Tullius Military Reform - Census"
 rome.17.d:0 "Servius constitution consisted of 2 parts, and first one was census. The census classified Rome's male citizen population according to status, wealth and age. The classes were subdivided into groups called centuriae (centuries), nominally of 100 men, further divided into seniores (men aged 46 – 60, of a suitable age to serve as "home guards" or city police) and iuniores (men aged 17 – 45, to serve as front-line troops when required). Adult male citizens were obliged, when called upon, to fulfill military service according to their means, which was supposedly assessed by as, a monetary unit that in the archaic period represented a particular weight of bronze. A citizen's wealth and class would therefore have defined their position in the civil hierarchies, and up to a point, within the military; but despite its apparent military character, and its possible origins as the mustering of the citizenry-at-arms, the system would have primarily served to determine the voting qualifications and wealth of individual citizens for taxation purposes, and the weight of their vote."

 rome.18.t:0 "Servius Tullius Reforms - Curiate Reforms"
 rome.18.d:0 "Until the Servian reforms, the passing of laws and judgment was the prerogative of the comitia curiata (curiate assembly), made up from thirty curiae. Roman sources describe ten curiae for each of the three aristocratic tribes, the Ramnes, the Tities, and the Luceres, each claiming patrician status and privilege to election as magistrates by virtue of their descent from Rome's founding families. These tribes, supposedly based on three of Rome's hills, comprised approximately 200 gentes (clans), each of which contributed one senator ("elder") to the Senate. Roman tradition held that Servius formed a comitia centuriata of commoners, elected by the citizens as a whole, to augment or displace the comitia curiata as Rome's central legislative body. This required his development of the first Roman census, making Servius the first Roman censor. The institution of the census and the comitia centuriata are speculated as Servius' attempt to erode the civil and military power of the Roman aristocracy, and seek the direct support of his newly enfranchised citizenry in civil matters; if necessary, under arms. The comitia curiata continued to function through the Regal and Republican eras, but the Servian reform had reduced its powers to those of a largely symbolic "upper house" whose noble members were expected to do no more than ratify decisions of the comitia centuriata."

The manipular formation started adaptation into Roman army in that period, probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south. Under the new system, men were sorted into based on wealth - rich triarii, little bit poorer principes, poorer hastati, even poorer rorarii and accensii, poorest of poorest. At the start soldiers was fighting in old phalanx style, that was later changed by manipular "chess-formation"."

Under a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, with the hastati being the youngest and least experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to that which existed under the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears, and two pila - heavy throwing javelins. Also the extraordinary demands of the Punic Wars, in addition to a shortage of manpower. Around 213 BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses to allow more people into army. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) for the provision of allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions."

The wall was up to 10 metres (32.8 ft) in height in places, 3.6 metres (12 ft) wide at its base, 11 km (7 mi) long, and is believed to have had 16 main gates, though many of these are mentioned only from writings, with no other known remains. It is presumed that the wall is named after the sixth Roman King, Servius Tullius. Although its outline may go back to the 6th century BC, the currently extant wall was, it is estimated, built during the early Roman Republic, possibly as a way to prevent a repeat of the sack of Rome after the Battle of the Allia by the Gauls of Brennus. The wall became unnecessary as Rome became well protected by the ever expanding military strength of the Republic and of the later Empire. As the city continued to grow and prosper, it was essentially unwalled for the first three centuries of the Empire. When German tribes made further incursions along the Roman frontier in the 3rd century AD, Emperor Aurelian had the larger Aurelian Walls built to protect Rome. Today sections of the Servian Wall are still visible in various locations around Rome."

The situation was further aggravated by smaller floods along the lower course of the Yellow River. The peasants were further oppressed by high taxes imposed in order to fund the construction of fortifications along the Silk Road and garrisons against foreign infiltration and invasion. In this situation, landowners, landless peasants, and unemployed former-soldiers formed armed bands, and eventually private armies, setting the stage for armed conflict. Because of its plan for a new beginning, the Taoist sect of Zhang Jue was to prove to be the Han dynasty's most dangerous enemy. In preparation for his revolt, Zhang Jue sent disciples out to gain support and organize followers throughout north China. They were helped by local political discontent, and by droughts and plague among the people.

It is thought that there may have been 139 demes which were organized into three groups called trittyes, with ten demes divided among three regions in each trittyes. Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of demonymics, thus increasing Athenians' sense of belonging to a deme. He also established sortition - the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity, a true test of real democracy. He reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouletic oath, 'To advise according to the laws what was best for the people'. The court system was reorganized and had from 201-5001 jurors selected each day, up to 500 from each tribe. It was the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned for amendments by the assembly. Cleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism, whereby a vote from more than 6,000 of the citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the democracy. However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile. Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny."

 macedon.14.d:0 "The phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx. The 'phalangites' were armed with much longer spears, and less heavily armoured. Since the sarissa was wielded two-handed, phalangites carried much smaller shields that were strapped to their arms. Therefore, although a Macedonian phalanx would have formed up in a similar manner to the hoplite phalanx, it possessed very different tactical properties. With the extra spear length, up to five rows of phalangites could project their weapon beyond the front rank—keeping the enemy troops at a greater distance. The Macedonian phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would have compensated for this. Such a phalanx formation also reduces the likelihood that battles would degenerate into a pushing match."

Scylax and his companions set out from the city of Caspatyrus (Gandhara), which would mean he entered the Indus River at Peshawar, Pakistan. Scylax sailed down the river until he found it reached the Arabian Sea. He then sailed west across the Arabian Sea until he arrived at the Red Sea, which he also explored. He travelled as far as the Red Sea's western end at Suez, before returning to report to Darius I. His entire journey took thirty months. Such, at least, is the prima facie narrative based on Herodotos. Recently, however, Dmitri Panchenko has argued persuasively, on the basis of apparent references to Scylax's work in the late Greek author Philostratos, that Scylax not only travelled through Pakistan, but in fact also travelled to North India as well, and made his way down the Ganges, and arriving at Taprobane (Sri Lanka). He has also calculated the likely date of Scylax's departure for India as July 518 BC."

 syracuse.2.t:0 "The Revolt Of Duketios"
 syracuse.2.d:0 "Sicily at this time was under the tyranny of Gelo and his brother Hiero. After the death of Hiero in 467 BC, Syracuse became a democracy. There were however, troubles in the aftermath of the tyranny's collapse. War had broken out between Syracuse and its former colony Catana in 460 BC. Ducetius assisted Syracuse because Catana had occupied Sicel land, and together defeated them. Ducetius went on to found the city of Menai and occupy Morgantina. By 452 BC he had united central Sicily and founded the city of Palice, the seat of his power, near the Lacus Palicorum, then two holy crater lakes and site of a temple to the Sicel gods of Palici. The city grew quickly as it became a place of refuge for runaway slaves. Ducetius then conquered Aetna, southwest of Mount Etna, before moving into Agrigentum. Syracuse, although an ally, became concerned by Ducetius' unchecked expansion. However, Ducetius did not necessarily pose a threat to Syracuse in the same way Carthage had. But with Ducetius' taking in 451 BC of Motyon, a stronghold held by Agrigentum, Syracuse decided to assist Agrigentum, but was not able defeat him. It was in this year that Ducetius' Sicel empire was at its height. Only a year later in 450 BC, it would be decisively defeated at Nomae. His surviving army was scattered amongst the Sicel cities, and Ducetius was left with only a handful of followers. Agrigentum retook Motyon and Ducetius fled to Syracuse. Ducetius was tried by a politically moderate general assembly in Syracuse. They voted to pay to have him exiled to Corinth, Syracuse's mother-city, on the condition that he never return to Sicily."

When Harran was captured by the alliance in 609 BC, ending the Assyrian Empire, remnants of the Assyrian army joined Carchemish, a city under Egyptian rule, on the Euphrates. Egypt, a former vassal of Assyria, was allied with Assyrian King Ashur-uballit II and marched in 609 BC to his aid against the Babylonians...or possibly to take the Syria for themselves? \n\nThe Egyptian army of Pharaoh Necho II was delayed at Megiddo by the forces of King Josiah of Judah. Josiah was killed, and his army was defeated at the Battle of Megiddo. The Egyptians and the Assyrians together crossed the Euphrates and laid siege to Harran, which they failed to retake. They then retreated to northwestern Assyria in what is now northeastern Syria.\n\nThe Egyptians met the full might of the Babylonian and Median army led by Nebuchadnezzar II at Carchemish, where the combined Egyptian and Assyrian forces were destroyed. Assyria ceased to exist as an independent power, and Egypt retreated and was no longer a significant force in the Ancient Near East."

These years of lacklustre military performance saw some of Babylon's vassals, particularly in the Levant, beginning to doubt Babylon's power, viewing the Neo-Babylonian Empire as a paper tiger rather than a power truly on the level of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The situation grew so severe that people in Babylonia itself began disobeying the king, some going as far as to revolt against Nebuchadnezzar's rule."

 macedon.25.d:0 "The origins of the city are obscure, and so is the precise date of its incorporation into the kingdom of Macedonia - local epigraphy suggests that Pella have been conquered by the Temenid (Argead) kings around 510-505 BC. But it is possible that it retained a certain autonomy until the middle of the 5th century, as is probably the case for its neighbor town of Ichnai, which continued to mint its own currency until around 480 BC. local epigraphes study suggests that in 5th century BC Pella area had mixed Greco-barbarian population, probably living in mixed greco-paeonian or greco-mygdonian settlements, like the several other towns in the central Macedonian plain around the Thermaic Gulf - Ichnai, Chalastra, Sindos and Thermae."

 macedon.26.t:0 "Revolts in Pella"
 macedon.26.d:0 "Xenophon states that Pella was the largest city in Macedonia at the beginning of 4th century BC. It was either King Archelaus or more probably Amyntas III who made it the capital of the kingdom and attracted renowned Greek artists such as the painter Zeuxis, the poet Timothy of Miletus and, above all, the tragic Euripides who ended his days there after having written there and had Archelaus represented. This change in political status is accompanied by the installation of Macedonian settlers and leads to a demographic change also perceptible in the epigraphy - the attested onomastics in fact takes on a more diverse coloring, where the Ionic influence is less predominant. Macedonian names now sit alongside others of "Panhellenic" origin. Amyntas III's decision to make Pella his capital is perhaps explained by the need to better control the "New Territories" of the kingdom, as the ancient Greek cities were still rebelling under the influence of the Chalcidice confederation, the neighbor of Macedon. As example of this malign influence - greeks in Pella itself revolted in 383 BC."

He was a capable and beneficent ruler, known for the sweeping changes he made in state administration, the military, and commerce. By the time that he died, Archelaus had succeeded in converting Macedon into a significantly stronger power.

This left the Athenians in desperate need of a huge amount of timber to build new ships and Archelaus in a position to set the price.

The Illyrians began to prepare to invade Macedon; meanwhile, the Paionians were ravaging Macedonian territory, the Thracians were preparing to invade in support of the pretender Pausanias, as were the Athenians, in support of a different pretender, Argeus. In short, Macedon was in another of its periodic crises that ruined country for more than a century. The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was only an infant. Philip, the sole surviving son of Amyntas III, brother of Perdiccas III, that spent most of his childhood as a hostage in Thebes, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as regent first, and then as a king. To strenghten his claim he immediately married his brother widow, Phila, sister of princes of Elimeia. In any case, Philip II came to power by 359 BC, and began energetic attempts to save Macedon from destruction. \n\n§RNOTE TO PLAYER FROM AUTHOR - This is non-scenario case of Philip II, you may also expect Alexander the Great to be born soon, but rest is not scripted, so who will you fight or invade, or will you invade at all - depends only from you.§"

These were intended for recitation, and not committed to writing. But such performances did not suit the taste of the Athenians, and nothing more is heard of them until eighty years after the time of Susarion. \n\n 'Listen people. These are the words of Susarion, son of Philinus, from Tripodeske in Megara. Women are a bane - but nevertheless it is not possible to live in a household without bane. For to marry or not to marry, either is baneful.'"

 greek.23.d:0 "The First Sacred War, or Cirraean War, was fought between the Amphictyonic League of Delphi and the city of Kirrha. At the beginning of the 6th century BC the Pylaeo-Delphic Amphictyony, controlled by the Thessalians, attempted to take hold of the Sacred Land (or Kirrhaean Plain) of Apollo, resulting in this war. The conflict arose due to Kirrha's frequent robbery and mistreatment of pilgrims going to Delphi and their encroachments upon Delphic land. The war, which culminated with the defeat and destruction of Kirrha, is notable for the use of chemical warfare at the Siege of Kirrha, in the form of hellebore being used to poison the city's water supply. \n The leader of the attack was the Tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon, who used his powerful navy to blockade the city's port before using an allied Amphictionic army to besiege Kirrha. The Athenians also participated with a contingent led by Alcmaeon. On the Thessalian side, the leaders were Eurylochos and Hippias."
 greek.23.a:0 "No mercy!"
 greek.24.t:0 "First Sacred War End"
 greek.24.d:0 "What transpired after this is a matter of debate - the earliest, and therefore probably most reliable, account is that of the medical writer Thessalos. He wrote, in the 5th century BC, that the attackers discovered a secret water-pipe leading into the city after it was broken by a horse's hoof. An asclepiad named Nebros advised the allies to poison the water with hellebore which soon rendered the defenders so weak with diarrhea that they were unable to resist the assault. Nebros was considered an ancestor of Hippocrates, so this story has caused many to wonder whether it might not have been guilt over his ancestor's use of poison that drove Hippocrates to establish the Hippocratic Oath. \nKirrha was captured and the entire population was slaughtered, and rare who remained were resettled, and their lands dedicated to Apollo. Delphi itself returned into control of League. The war's end also was marked by the organization of the first Pythian Games to celebrate the victory."

 mytilene.3.t:0 "Sappho of Lesbos"
 mytilene.3.d:0 "Sappho (c.630-c.570 BC) was an Archaic Greek poet from Eresos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by music. In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the "Tenth Muse" and "The Poetess". Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; only the Ode to Aphrodite is certainly complete. As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams formerly attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style. \n\nLittle is known of Sappho's life. She was from a wealthy family from Lesbos, though her parents' names are uncertain. Ancient sources say that she had three brothers; Charaxos, Larichos and Eurygios. Two of them, Charaxos and Larichos, are mentioned in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. She was exiled to Sicily around 600 BC, and may have continued to work until around 570 BC. \n\nSappho was a prolific poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. She was best-known in antiquity for her love poetry; other themes in the surviving fragments of her work include family and religion. She probably wrote poetry for both individual and choral performance. Most of her best-known and best-preserved fragments explore personal emotions and were probably composed for solo performance. Her works are known for their clarity of language, vivid images, and immediacy. The context in which she composed her poems has long been the subject of scholarly debate; the most influential suggestions have been that she had some sort of educational or religious role, or wrote for the symposium.\n\nSappho's poetry was well-known and greatly admired through much of antiquity, and she was among the canon of Nine Lyric Poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Sappho's poetry is still considered extraordinary and her works continue to influence other writers. Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women, with the English words sapphic and lesbian deriving from her name and that of her home island respectively."

 mytilene.4.t:0 "Alcaeus of Mytilene"
 mytilene.4.d:0 "Alcaeus of Mytilene (c.625-c.580 BC) was a lyric poet from the Greek island of Lesbos who is credited with inventing the Alcaic stanza. He was included in the canonical list of nine lyric poets by the scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. \nHe was born into the aristocratic governing class of Mytilene, the main city of Lesbos, where he was involved in political disputes and feuds. \n\nAlcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of Sappho and, since both poets composed for the entertainment of Mytilenean friends, they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis, such as at the Kallisteia, an annual festival celebrating the island's federation under Mytilene, held at the 'Messon', where Sappho performed publicly with female choirs. Alcaeus' reference to Sappho in terms more typical of a divinity, as holy/pure, honey-smiling Sappho, may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival. The Lesbian or Aeolic school of poetry "reached in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after-wards approached" and it was assumed by later Greek critics and during the early centuries of the Christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers, a theme which became a favourite subject in art "

Here he met with the forces of the Chaldean King of Babylon Nabopolassar, who had been at war with Assyria for over 12 years. There they united forces by forming an alliance and marched in to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 613 BC By August of the next year the city had fallen to the coalition. The battle was fierced with the Sagartians and Medes being the decisive factor in the victory but also the ones who most savagely plundered the city; major buildings were severely damaged and the palaces were completely burned down. It was during the sacking that the King of Assyria himself Shin-Shar-Ishkun died while defending the palace.

In this culture livestock rearing was rare along with horse riding, bronze artifacts were also rare but megalithic construction was common and it is theorized by some modern linguists and archaeologists that the culture of the south was not koreanic but japonic originally.\nHowever, the culture of the south would start to be replaced by a more northern like by the beginning of the 3rd century BC as southern funerary rites start to imitate those of the north, livestock production increases and the prominent korean bronze sword was now a common artifact among the elite, hinting to either an upper class replacement or cultural shift from a possibly japonic substratum to a koreanic culture.\nIt is currently unknown what could have possibly caused this shift in culture in South Korea, but some of the modern theories state that it were korean migrants from the north, possibly refugees of the Yan-Joseon conflict, who started to replace the upper class of the south as this is the case in the myth of King Jun, a former Joseon king who founded a new state in Mahan."

With this loss it is now impossible to see a resurgance of the former Elamite state, and there is no hope anymore, only despair.

By accepting the requests we could gain some money and manpower for our armies, but this migration could increase Zari's population as well as even changing the demographics of the land. However, since the collapse of the old Elam, our country is already inhabited by various other peoples so the main problem with this settlement are not the Chaldeans but the possible tensions with Babylonia. If we agree with Zari, the other Sukkal will not approve of this action."

Due to the oppresive reign of Assyrians and Lybians throughout Egypt, Seth was demonized as being an evil god of trickery, the lord of the desert and the traitor who killed his own brother, Osiris, and fought against Osiris.

 dacian.1.d:0 "At the start of rule of our great king, Dacia was lost to decadence and debauchery. \nMany dacians are now following dyonisian cults, or any other perverted greek cults - people are constantly drinking undiluted wine, or participating in disgusting orgies. That makes our people weak, and all neighbours are laughting at us! \nDeceneus, a priest and magician who recently arrived to our court, is giving us the solution - to reform the cult of Zalmoxis - long time dead philosopher god-king. Now he will be the sole deity, ruler of the underworld, lord of our souls, and we will know no death, but will be reborn after meeting him. His cult will also involve possible ban of wine, which has been harming our spirits so much, and will make us more... Disciplined and organized. And of course, Deceneus is aiming to become the lead priest of this new deity. \nThe Wise king should now decide... Will this new religion be of use to his united realm, or is it better to stick to the old ways?"

 rm.1.d:0 "In 360 BC, the Macedonian army under Perdiccas III had been defeated in battle by the king Bardylis, who invaded country with army of Dardanians(tribal kingdom of Illyria); Perdiccas and 4,000 troops had been killed. The Illyrians began to prepare to invade Macedon; meanwhile, the Paionians were ravaging Macedonian territory, the Thracians were preparing to invade in support of the pretender Pausanias, as were the Athenians, in support of a different pretender, Argeus. In short, Macedon was in another of its periodic crises that ruined country for more than a century. The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was only an infant. Philip, the sole surviving son of Amyntas III, brother of Perdiccas III, that spent most of his childhood as a hostage in Thebes, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as regent first, and then as a king. To strenghten his claim he immediately married his brother widow, Phila, sister of princes of Elimeia. In any case, Philip II came to power by 359 BC, and began energetic attempts to save Macedon from destruction. \n\n§RNOTE TO PLAYER FROM AUTHOR OF THIS BOOKMARK - This is highly scripted Role Playing bookmark, created for you to feel the Philipp II experience at full extent.

Year after a turmoil started in Paeonia, against unpopular Agis."

With the aid of the Thessalians, Amyntas III later succeeded in expelling Argaeus II and recovering a part of his kingdom in 392 BC. \nSeeing the Macedon in its weakest state, Athens are willing to install Argeus as a puppet-king on throne, and extend their controll on entire region in that way, as it was once before. To support Argeus claim, Athens decided to sent strategos Manlias with 2k hoplites. Athens decided that 2 thousand professional mercenaries will be enough to finish the kingdom. Landed in Methone, Argeus with other mercenaries and supporters, marched straigh to Aegai, ancient capital of Macedon, to seek support of nobility. Hovewer his mercenaries looted some manors around city, and that has angered Aigai inhabitants, and they closed the gates, leaving Argeus without much hoped support, and forcing to retreat to Methone. \nNow that was a perfect time for Philipp to test his newborn phalanx agaist greek phalanx, and strenghten his claim to throne by defeating that pretender. \n Note - Historically Philipp not only defeated Argeus, but persuaded Manlias to hold most of his troops and fleet idle in Methone, and persuaded Athens in his friendly opinion of their cause. \n§RDefeat Argeus!§"

 rm.6.d:0 "Philip's first achievement was to unify Macedon through his army. He raised troops and made his army the single fount of wealth, honour and power in the land; the unruly chieftains of Macedonia became the officers and elite cavalrymen of the army, the highland peasants became the footsoldiers. Philip took pains to keep them always under arms and either fighting or drilling. Manoeuvres and drills were made into competitive events, and the truculent Macedonians vied with each other to excel. As a political counterbalance to the native-born Macedonian nobility, Philip invited military families from throughout Greece to settle on lands he had conquered or confiscated from his enemies, these 'personal clients' then also served as army officers or in the Companion cavalry."

 rm.7.t:0 "War with Bardylis"
 rm.7.d:0 "Time has come to revenge Bardylis and return macedonian lands!\nWith his northern frontier safe for the time being, Philip turned westward that summer to regain the territory lost by his brother. The Illyrians presented a daunting challenge, able to match Philip's manpower with 10,000 infantry and 500 cavalry of their own against Philips slightly advantageous 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. Moreover, Bardyllis' infantry had a strong component of shock fighters, possibly making up 7,000 of the total. The Illyrian warriors used a heavy-headed sibyna spear and bossed shield. Philip had to have known that they would put his as yet untried hypaspists and native phalangites to a stern test of hand-to-hand combat. The Macedonians weren't facing a newly enfranchised king like Philip, but rather a grizzled veteran of many wars, as Bardyllis might have been 90 years old, yet was still sturdy enough to take the field on horseback.\nHistorically Philip II and Bardylis armies met somewhere near the Erigon Valley. Both armeis were of same strengh, both Philippe phalanx, and dardanian greek-armed veterans. This battle was brutally bloody, and it is belived Bardylis was slain in it or died soon after that defeat. \n§R Occupy Western Macedonia up to Scupi, and victory event should fire.§"

 rm.8.t:0 "Battle of Erigon Valley"
 rm.8.d:0 "The Illyrians moved to offer battle on open ground. Hammond suggests that this was just west of Kirli Dirven pass on the plain of Lyncus. Philip arrived and deployed his phalanx much as he had done in its first action, with the phalangites at left and centre, hired hoplites and hypaspites from the right in that order again and cavalry and light infantry split off both wings. This indicates that Bardyllis set up in a linear fashion, his heavy infantry matching the phalanx's width with even deeper files and having the best men fronting in the middle with cavalry and skirmishers outboard.\nThe formations had closed together, Illyrian at quick pace and Macedonian slowly as to keep good order. When they finally met, a vicious melee was set in motion from one end of the field to the other. All the elements of the phalanx at this point moved in chorus to execute their deadly tasks. Left through centre the pikemen held firm, their long weapons keeping Illyrian spear points out of range as they wounded at least a few among those leading the Illyrian effort. At the same time, Philip and his spearmen made progress on the right striking into the Illyrians as momentum from the rear ranks pushed them relentlessly ahead. The Illyrian front-fighters opposing them got much less help from behind and were powerless to resist the intense, file-length pressure coming at them. In the end, the Illyrians had no choice but to yield ground. As the Illyrians left began edging back, it was the hetairoi and their skirmishers that now excelled, easing the way for the hoplites and hypaspists by clearing all Illyrian cavalry and light infantry from that flank. Exposed and put beyond endurance, the Illyrian left now gave way completely and sent the rest of their formation into a frantic flight under fierce pursuit. In this battle, the troubling issue of Lynkestis was solved, changing the situation in the western borders in favor of Macedonia. \nPhilip secured Macedonians northwest frontier by annexing Illyrian territory as far as Lynkestis. This would form a defensive buffer against any future Illyrian raids attempted through the Drilon Valley. The borders between the Illyrian and the Macedonians remained around Lake Ohrid for a long time. After battle at Erigon Valley, Dardania strengh was broken by a rising power of Philipp II - Upper Macedonia was ceded to Macedon. \n§R Now celebrate, and wait a bit to decide fate of treacherous lincestians, that also claim your throne, and then set a new course for country economy.§"

Bachiadae princes were taken as officers into army, to be always under control of the king. Then Philipp decided to start new era of polis foundations, and founded Heraclea Lyncestis on a ruins of older lyncestian settlement.

It entered a new phase of prosperity as a cosmopolitan centre. The city itself kept its independence until the reign of king Philip II despite several Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of Callistratus of Aphidnae. Some years before Amphipolis accepted small regiments of macedonians to strenghten gainst athenian attacks. However in 357 BC city rebelled against a macedonian garrison, stationed there, threw it out and proclaimed independance.\n Meanwhile Paeonians are in the turmoil, and are also allied themselves to Athens in a coalition against us! This is a time for Parmenion to teach them a lesson, while Philipp is busy with Amphipolis. \n§R Take this opportunity to annex or vassalize Paeonia, and as well annex the city of Amphipolis itself and Krenides - your crucial source of gold for a final army reform.

The Athenian generals Chares and Chabrias were given command of the Athenian fleet. Satrap of Caria, Mausolus, cooperated with Rhodians to help them in a war against Athens.\n Chares was in need of money for his war effort but frowned upon asking it from home; thus, partly compelled by his mercenaries, he entered the service of the revolted Persian satrap Artabazus. The Athenians originally approved this collaboration but then ordered it to be dropped due to the Persian king Artaxerxes III Ochus's complaint and their fear of Persian support for the revolting confederates.\n Furthermore, as a result of increasing Athenian operations near the Persian empire, in 356 BC Persia asked Athens to leave Asia Minor, threatening war. In 355 BC Athens, not in any shape for another war, complied and withdrew, recognizing the independence of the confederate allies."

 rm.13.d:0 "In 362 BC, Orontes reappears in sources as the hyparch of Mysia, subordinate to the satrap Autophradates at Sardis. Before that period, Orontes was attempting to expand his domain. As demonstrated by his coinage at Adramyttium and Cisthenes, he recruited mercenaries, who helped him capture the city of Cyme and defeat the cavalry forces sent there by Autophradates to stop him. In 361 BC, Orontes was chosen as the leader of the revolting satraps of Asia Minor due to his aristocratic background, his kinship with Artaxerxes II, as well as his hostility towards the latter. The revolt was a culmination of a series of revolts led by other satraps, starting from 366 BC. The details of Orontes' revolt are obscure. He may have reached as far as Syria, but this remains disputed. The revolt was shortlived, as Orontes betrayed his allies and shifted his allegiance back to Artaxerxes II. According to the classical Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, Orontes thought that he would be greatly rewarded if he did so at such a critical point. Since Orontes was in possession of the troops and money, many other rebellious satraps followed suit. By 359 BC, the revolt had ended.\n Orontes revolted a second time in 354 BC, most likely due to his disappointment with the rewards he received by the king. He seized the town of Pergamon, but eventually reconciled with Artaxerxes II's son and successor Artaxerxes III (r. 358–338 BC) and gave him back the town."

Apparently, she was originally named Polyxena, as Plutarch mentions in his work Moralia, and changed her name to Myrtale prior to her marriage to Philip II of Macedon as part of her initiation into an unknown mystery cult. The name Olympias was the third of four names by which she was known.

He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus.

In 355 BC Athens, not in any shape for another war, complied and withdrew, recognizing the independence of the confederate allies. Chares' war party was replaced by a peaceful one under Eubulus.

 rm.26.d:0 "The Third Sacred War (356–346 BC) was fought between the forces of the Delphic Amphictyonic League, principally represented by Thebes, and latterly by Philip II of Macedon, and the Phocians. The war was caused by a large fine imposed in 357 BC on the Phocians by the Amphictyonic League (dominated at that moment by Thebes), for the offense of cultivating sacred land; refusing to pay, the Phocians instead seized the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, and used all the holy treasures of Oracle, accumulated in centuries, to fund large mercenary armies. \n Thus, although the Phocians suffered several major defeats, they were able to continue the war for many years, until eventually all parties were nearing exhaustion. Philip II used the distraction of the other states to increase his power in northern Greece, in the process becoming ruler of Thessaly. \nIn the end, Philip's growing power, and the exhaustion of the other states, allowed him to impose a peaceful settlement of the war, marking a major step in the rise of Macedon to pre-eminence in Ancient Greece.\n§R Attack Pherae and Phocis, and take eastern Thessaly for yourself§."

 rm.27.d:0 "Meanwhile, Onomarchos returned to Thessaly to try to preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year. Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched Chares to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip. Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived. According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea, probably in the vicinity of Pagasae. Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; "as if he was the avenger... Of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god". In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6,000 Phocian troops were killed including Onomarchos, and another 3,000 taken prisoner. Onomarchos was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as ritual demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians.\n Re-organisation of Thessaly\nIt was probably in the aftermath of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip archon of Thessaly. This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thesslian army.\nPhilip was now able to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He first probably finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly. Pagasae was not part of the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it. The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis. Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he tightened his control of Perrhaebia, and invaded Magnesia, also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; "when finished, he was lord of Thessaly.""

 rm.28.d:0 "Peace of Philocrates is the name given to the peace treaty concluded in 346 BC between Athens and Macedon under Philip II. Philocrates was the name of the main Athenian negotiator of the Treaty.\n\nAthens and Macedon had been at war since 356 BC, after Philip's capture of the Athenian colonies of Pydna and Potidea. Shortly afterwards, the Third Sacred War began after the Phocian seizure of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. Athens allied herself with Phocis, against the other members of the Amphictyonic League. In 354 or 353 BC, the Thessalians, having been defeated by the Phocians, requested that Philip become archon of Thessaly, to which Philip assented, drawing Macedon into the Sacred War. In 352 BC, Philip's erstwhile ally, the Chalkidian League (led by Olynthos), alarmed by Philip's growing power, sought to ally themselves with Athens, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip. In response, Philip attacked Chalkidiki in 349 BC, and by 348 BC, had completely destroyed the Chalkidian League, razing Olynthos in the process. \nNegotiations were ceased and reassembled many times, but in the end Athens had to accept it. \nAll of central Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. However, the Athenians were still ignorant of this turn of events when Phocian ambassadors came to Athens to plead for military aid around 9 July. The Athenian council recommended that the peace be rejected, and Thermopylae be occupied in order to help save Phocis; since, as far at the Athenian embassy knew, Philip's troops were still in Pherae, there seemed to be ample time to occupy the pass. By 12 July the news that Philip was "in the gates" arrived in Athens; the Athenians then knew that the situation was hopeless, and instead of acting on the previous recommendation of the council, the Assembly instead passed a motion re-affirming the Peace of Philocrates."

As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC. \n Philip probably also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly after returning to Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, on the coast of the Propontis \n§R Attack Odomantii, Western Odrysia and Central Odrysia, in that order preferably - start with Odrysia.§."

He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed to leave with his mercenaries and go wherever he wished. Cawkwell suggests that Phalaikos probably collaborated with Philip in 346 BC, allowing Philip to take Thermopylae in return for lenience for him and his men."

 rm.34.d:0 "Chalkidian League had made peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. From that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, the next few years of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.\nPhilip finally began his campaign against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly at or near Stageira). Philip seems to have methodically worked his way around the 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen the fate of the cities which resisted Philip. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.\n Finally, in probably June 348 BC, with all the other cities captured or in submission, Philip moved to attack Olynthos. According to Diodorus, there were two pitched battles against the Olynthians; after being defeated twice, the Olynthians were then confined to the city. Two of the commanders of Olynthos, Euthycrates and Lasthenes, defected to Philip with 500 cavalry shortly before the siege. \n§R End the Chalkidike§."

 rm.35.d:0 "Athens was prevented from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought to unite the cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning the end of the hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. \nIn 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.\nIn early 348 BC, the Athenians were distracted by events on Euboea, and were in no position to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines."

While Philipp was busy sieging and fighting Athenian controlled coastal greek colonies in Thrace like Potidea, Oesyme or Abdera, Parmenion was in charge of army fighting the illyrians. \nAccording to Diodorus, Philip marched on his enemies in this alliance before they had chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers over the next few years, with the exception of Athens.\nAccording to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion heroically defeated the Illyrians under king Grabos II in 356 BC, shortly after the conclusion of the siege of Potidea.

 rm.43.d:0 "At the end of his Thracian campaign, Philip moved against the city of Perinthos, formerly his ally.[156] Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, there is no indication that this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars. \n Philip started the siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos occupied a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip did not have a large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of the wall was breached.\nHowever, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of soldiers and their best generals. The Byzantians' actions meant that they too were now at war with Philip. He continued the siege of Perinthos, but now (September) sent half his army to besiege Byzantion. Byzantion was a more important city for Philip, because of its control of the Bosphorus;\n§R You can try to take the cities, but better leave them be, as they are prepared and barely siegeable.

Ateas initially allied with Philip II of Macedonia, but eventually this alliance fell apart. \n Towards the end of his life, Ateas increasingly encroached upon the Greek-Macedonian sphere of influence in the Balkans. Greek sources record his campaign against the tribe of the Histriani in Thrace. At first Ateas found it prudent to enlist the assistance of Macedon. When Philip's troops arrived to Scythia, they were dismissed with derision - the king of the Histriani had died and military action was no longer on the agenda. Another collision between Philip and Ateas arose during the former's siege of Byzantium, when the Scythians refused to provide Macedonian troops with supplies, citing the barrenness of their land as a pretext.\n These petty conflicts with Ateas gave Philip a ground for invading his dominions. The final straw was the Scythians' reluctance to allow Philip to dedicate a statue of Heracles at the Danube estuary. \n§R Defeat few scythian stacks or occupy some provs, while preventing them from occupying yours, up to 10-15% warscore, to finish this war. §"

After years of extensive and meticulous preparations, the King assembled and led in person a large host which included Greek mercenaries from Thebes, Argos, Asia Minor, and those commanded by the turncoat mercenary Mentor of Rhodes, as well as a war fleet and a number of transport ships. Although the Artaxerxes's army considerably outnumbered that of his Egyptian counterpart Nectanebo II, the difficulty of marching through the dry land south of Gaza and the many rivers of Upper Egypt still posed, as in previous invasions, a challenge, which was compounded, according to Diodorus Siculus, by the refusal of the Persians to make use of local guides. The invasion started poorly, as Artaxerxes lost some troops to quicksand at Barathra, and an attempt by his Theban troops to take Pelusium was successfully counterattacked by the garrison.\n Artaxerxes then created three divisions of shock troops, each with a Greek commander and a Persian supervisor, while remaining himself in command of the reserves. One unit, to which he assigned the Thebans, a force of cavalry and Asiatic infantry, was tasked with taking Pelusium, while a second, commanded by Mentor of Rhodes and the eunuch Bagoas, was sent against Bubastis. The third division, which comprised the Argives, some unspecified elite troops and 80 triremes, was to establish a bridgehead on the opposite bank of the Nile. After an attempt to dislodge the Argives failed, Nectanebo retreated to Memphis, which prompted the besieged garrison of Pelusium to surrender. Bubastis likewise capitulated, as the Greek mercenaries in the garrison came to terms with the Persians after falling out with the Egyptians. This was followed by a wave of surrenders, which opened the Nile to Artaxerxes's fleet and caused Nectanebo to lose heart and abandon his country.\n After this victory over the Egyptians, Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. Persia gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken Egypt enough that it could never revolt against Persia. For the 10 years that Persia controlled Egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen. Before he returned to Persia, he appointed Pherendares as satrap of Egypt. With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt, Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries.

 rm.49.d:0 "Philip's campaign in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, sacred war. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided to declare a sacred war against Amphissa. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to campaign in Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.\nPhilip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC. \nDuring this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try to avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful."

 rm.50.d:0 "When news first arrived that Philip was in Elatea, just three days march away, there was panic in Athens. Demosthenes alone counselled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, in the cause of liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.\nThe details of the campaign leading up to the decisive Battle of Chaeronea are almost completely unknown. Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helikon, as the Spartans had done in the run-up to the Battle of Leuctra, or by any of the other mountain passes. There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes; Demosthenes alludes to a "winter battle" and "battle on the river" in his speeches, but no other details are preserved. Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the allied Greek army defending the road at Chaeronea.\n§R Defeat athenian and boeotian forces, take Koroneia and Thebes, and have at least 20% warscore agains Thebes and 10 against Athens§."

 rm.51.t:0 "Battle of Chaeronea"
 rm.51.d:0 "The allied Greek army had taken up a position near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara and Troezen, with the majority of troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self-governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern view is that the allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Philip took command of the right wing of the Macedonian wing and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.\n Details of the battle itself are scarce, with Diodorus providing the only formal account. He says that "once joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides, so that for a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both."He then recounts that the young Alexander, "his heart set on showing his father his prowess" succeeding in rupturing the allied Greek line aided by his companions, and eventually put the allied Greek right wing to flight; meanwhile, Philip advanced in person against the allied Greek left and also put it to flight. This brief account can be filled out, if Polyaenus's anecdotes related to the battle (found in his work Stratagems) are to be believed. Polyaenus's accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis of the battle. \nAfter the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the allied Greek right and punched a hole in the allied Greek line. On the allied Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and became disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The allied Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then were also routed, ending the battle. Diodorus says that more than 1000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly.\n Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history; since there was now no army which could prevent Philip's advance, the war effectively ended.\n§R Now wait a few days for a establishment of League of Corynth§."

 rm.52.t:0 "Formation of League of Corynth"
 rm.52.d:0 "Since there was now no army which could prevent Philip's advance, the war effectively ended. In Athens and Corinth, records show desperate attempts to re-build the city walls, as they prepared for siege. However, Philip had no intention of besieging any city, nor indeed of conquering it. He wanted the southern Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians, and he wanted to leave a stable Greece in his rear when he went on campaign; further fighting was therefore contrary to his aims. Philip marched first to Thebes, which surrendered to him; he expelled the Theban leaders who had opposed him, recalled those pro-Macedonian Thebans who had previously been exiled, and installed a Macedonian garrison. He also ordered that the Boeotian cities of Plataea and Thespiae, which Thebes had destroyed in previous conflicts, be re-founded. Generally, Philip treated the Thebans severely, making them pay for the return of their prisoners, and even to bury their dead; he did not, however, dissolve the Boeotian Confederacy.\nBy contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently. Although the Second Athenian League was dissolved, the Athenians were allowed to keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip's motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians.\nPhilip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations both received Macedonian garrisons. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely to take advantage of the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.\nPhilip seems to have moved around in the months after the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and installing garrisons. His movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, that they should not try to oppose him. In mid 337 BC, he seems to have camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed in the latter half of 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta.\nThe principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'. At Philip's behest, the synod of the league then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign.\n§R Now wait a week or more for a polises to join to League of Corynth (Technically a tributaries, not league members, to avoid breaking Alexander conquest events with a wild greek stacks walking and swarming Persia)§."

Mentor became general of the maritime provinces, suppressed the rebels in Egypt and sent Greek mercenaries to the king, while Bagoas administered the satrapies and gained such power that he was almost the real master of the Empire towards the end of Artaxerxes III's reign.\nIn late August/late September 338 BC, the court eunuch, vizier and chiliarch (hazahrapatish) Bagoas orchestrated the poisoning and subsequent death of Artaxerxes III through the latters own physician, when the eunuch fell out of favour with him. Artaxerxes III's early death proved to be a problematic issue for Persia, and may have played a role in the weakening of the country.

From around 352 BC, he supported several Persian opponents to Artaxerxes III, such as Artabazos II, Amminapes or a Persian nobleman named Sisines, by receiving them for several years as exiles at the Macedonian court. This gave him a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of his innovations in the management of the Macedonian state. Alexander was also acquainted with these Persian exiles during his youth.\nIn 336 BC, Philip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Asia Minor to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been assassinated and had been succeeded as king by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes."

Eventually, disgruntled by this state of affairs and possibly influenced by the nobles of the Royal Court, who generally held Bagoas in contempt, Arses started planning Bagoas' murder. However, Bagoas again acted first in order to protect himself and managed to poison and kill Arses. Bagoas then raised a cousin of Arses, Codomannus, to the throne as Darius III.\nWhen Darius attempted to become independent of the powerful vizier, Bagoas tried to poison him too; but Darius was warned and forced Bagoas to drink the poison himself."

 rm.58.d:0 "King Philip was assassinated in October 336 BC at Aegae, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Macedon. Philip and his royal court were gathered in order to celebrate the marriage of Alexander I of Epirus and Cleopatra of Macedon – Philip's daughter by his fourth wife Olympias. While the king was entering into the town's theatre, he was unprotected in order to appear approachable to the Greek diplomats and dignitaries who were present at that time. Philip was suddenly approached by Pausanias of Orestis, one of his seven bodyguards, and was stabbed in his ribs. After Philip was killed, the assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his getaway associates, who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance to Aegae. The assassin was pursued by three of Philip's other bodyguards, and during the chase, his horse accidentally tripped on a vine. He was subsequently stabbed to death by the bodyguards.\nThe reasons for the assassination are difficult to ascertain. There was controversy even among ancient historians; the only known surviving contemporary account is that of Aristotle, who states simply that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by Attalus (Philip's uncle-in-law) and his friends. Attalus was the uncle of Philip's wife Cleopatra (renamed Eurydice upon marriage). \nCleitarchus' analysis:\nFifty years later, the historian Cleitarchus expanded and embellished the story. And centuries after that, this version was propagated by Diodorus Siculus and other historians who relied on Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history, Pausanias of Orestis had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias' taunting of the new lover caused the younger Pausanias to throw away his life in battle, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by getting Pausanias of Orestis drunk at a public dinner and then raping him.\nWhen Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with Parmenion to establish a bridgehead for an invasion he was planning. Also, Philip had recently married Attalus' niece, Cleopatra Eurydice. Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within his personal bodyguard. Pausanias then seems to have redirected his desire for revenge towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, and accordingly to plan to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was away in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan into action.\nJustin's analysis:\nOther historians (e.g., Justin 9.7) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother Olympias were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators. Olympias seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin's report - He writes that the same night of her return from exile, she placed a crown on the assassin's corpse, and later erected a tumulus over his grave and ordered that annual sacrifices be made to the memory of Pausanias.\nWhatever the actual background to the assassination, it may have had an enormous effect on later world events, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted. As asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have been content to make relatively moderate conquests, e.g., making Anatolia into a Macedonian province, and, unlike his son Alexander, not have wanted to push further into an overall conquest of Persia and further campaigns in India."

Hard-pressed by Syracuse, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance.  A considerable debate then took place in Rome as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for assistance. As the Carthaginians had already garrisoned Messana acceptance could easily lead to war with Carthage. The Romans had not previously displayed any interest in Sicily and did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful owners. However, many of them saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. The deadlocked Roman Senate, put the matter before the popular assembly, and the popular assembly decided to accept the Mamertines' request. A military expedition with orders to cross to Sicily and place a Roman garrison in Messana was sent...Thus, the First Punic War has started with the Romans landing on Sicily.\n\n\n (Occupy all Carthage lands in Sicily and has a positive +20 warscore in order to win the war.)"

But Romans were stubbornly pushing the Carthagenians on sea and on land, and in the end, after another defeat on sea, The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned. Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate Gisco.[163][164] The Treaty of Lutatius was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end - Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents over ten years.\n\n Almost immediately after that Carthage will face Mercenary war revolts of lybians and mercenaries, and if it will not be able to supress revolt in Sardinia quickly - Rome will get it."

 punic_wars.12.t:0 "Mercenary (Truceless) War"
 punic_wars.12.d:0 "The Mercenary War, also known as the Truceless War, was a mutiny by troops that were employed by Carthage at the end of the First Punic War (264-241 BC), supported by uprisings of African settlements revolting against Carthaginian control. It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt. The war began in 241 BC as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage in Sicily during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached, the army demanded even more, and erupted into full-scale mutiny and revolts of lybians, under the leadership of Spendius and Matho. In same time, revolts in Sardinia led to Rome occupying it and Corsica despite Carthage protests."

 punic_wars.13.d:0 "Probably in same time as Mercenary war was fought, the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and Corsica. Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The Roman Senate cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity. Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again...\n\n The Romans required a strong military presence on Sardinia and Corsica for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of Second Punic War with Carthage breaking out again nineteen years later."

Reputedly, he made his eldest son Hannibal swear a sacred oath upon an altar of the gods "to never be a friend of Rome". After the Roman victory, and bloody Mercenary War, he expanded the colonial possessions in Hispania, landing in Gadir with his veteran army of punics, lybians and numidians and his son Hasdrubal, effectively creating his own domain - fighting local tribes to get control of iberian silver or subdue them to get merrenaries for incoming war."

Zhao Dun, who had a reputation of incorruptibility and disliked the duke, tried to get him to stop his tyrannical ways. Duke Ling resented Zhao for this, and attempted to assassinate him, but failed. Shortly after, Zhao Dun's half brother Zhao Chuan rebelled and killed Duke Ling, and the two Zhaos installed the young Duke Cheng on the throne. Thus was the beginning of the decline of Jin's central control over its own state, and the rise of the various ministerial clans."

Not only that, but their proclamation hampers our legitimacy and may lead to others declaring themselves king, too. We could issue out anti-Chu propaganda and attempt to bring the various loyal states of the central plains together to attack Chu. If they're weakened enough, they may lose their title of king."

Although the procession was quite large, it turns out the gifts themselves are insignificant, including only a small number of cloths and pottery works.

After the fall of the Shang, human sacrifice became rare under the Zhou, but the practice persisted in parts of China that the Zhou did not control very well.\n\nToday seems to be an auspicious day for a sacrifice, and we could choose to bring some foreign subjects within our domain to the capital to appease the gods."

Thankfully, we, the rightful Sons of Heaven, have not only maintained our security but have also expanded enough to ensure our protection against the rebellious lords. Although we've until now clinged onto the old ways, it is clear that this is pointless as not even the countries of the central plains acknowledge our overlordship.

 china.44.d:0 "Our armies have marched on and occupied the royal Zhou capital of ChengZhou. Despite their great loss of political power, the city is nonetheless magnificent, with a huge amount of wealth just waiting to be plundered. Of course, sacking such an important city will anger all the Chinese states still loyal to the court, so it may be best to leave it untouched, instead."

 china.45.t:0 "Adopting New Reforms?"
 china.45.d:0 "The great states of the realm like Jin, Qi, Zheng, and so on, have taken to reforming their government and administration to further their bid for hegemony over the central plains.

 china.47.d:0 "With our recent conquest of Ba, we are in full control of the rich area known as Yi Zhou, and our capital of Chengdu and the old capital of Ba is flourishing. These centers are incredibly important to our state, and so some have requested that we invest resources to make them even more defendable. Others have said that we should use this wealth to expand our army. What should we do?"

Luckily, because of Qi's help, we were able to survive and move our capital to Puyang. The ministers of Li then sought refuge in our state. Now that we've made advances on the barbarians, the old ministers have approached us and requested that we free their old homeland from occupation. Apparantly, some of Li's former inhabitants fled to Hukou and continued resisting there. If they're still around, we could obtain their help in a future war of liberation."

 china.59.d:0 "Ever since the battle of Loulin, where we defeated the state of Xu (who was backed by many of the northern states), we have been advancing into the Huai river basin. Most recently, we conquered the state of Shu with the help of our Prime Minister Cheng Jia - however, as of now, our administration is quite overextended, and holding onto this land may prove to be difficult. It also might make the other Huaiyi states join together more closely to resist us, whereas backing away temporarily will give us an advantage in the future."

 china.61.d:0 "Gongsun Qiao, better known by his courtesy name Zichan, was a famous statesmen who served the state of Zheng during the Spring and Autumn period. He consolidated power from the nobles, established a publicly displayed law code (laws were normally hidden from commoners so the nobility could better abuse them), and generally strenghtened the Zheng state to a great degree. He was a shrewd and realist diplomat, and Confucius, who was only 30 years younger than Zichan, often spoke highly of him. Importantly, in the context of Confucianism, he upheld the traditional rites of Zhou, which were beginning to fall into decline as the Court and its cadet branches began to lose power throughout China. He would be forever known and praised by many throughout history."

 china.63.d:0 "We were once a great state, with our homeland being located at the city of Xingtai, Hebei. However, barbarians invaded us, and only by Qi were we saved. They relocated us to the county of Yiyi, but Wey later annexed us. Now that we've regained control of our homeland in the north, we should probably drop any claims people think we could have on Yiyi."
 china.63.a:0 "Yes, better to do so."

 china.64.t:0 "Sun Shuao"

 china.71.d:0 "Our Court has fallen into a state of decline, and it seems we can not sufficiently impress the ZhuHou like we once did. If we do not gain prestige, the lords may continue to snub us."
 china.71.a:0 "Is our Son of Heaven not prestigious enough?"
 china.72.t:0 "Stability Issues in the BaZhu's State"
 china.72.d:0 "The instability prevalent throughout the BaZhu's country has led to the ZhuHou perceiving us as weak, and thus our authority has temporarily declined."
 china.72.a:0 "It will be resolved soon enough..."
 china.74.t:0 "Removing Zhou Influence?"
 china.74.d:0 "Now that we have restored the great [Root.GetName] Dynasty, we have a hard decision to make. When the Zhou overthrew the Shang, they introduced many concepts that didn't exist before. The concept of Tian, the Mandate of Heaven, and the Rites of Zhou profoundly affected the Central Plains, and the culture of HuaXia is quite different than how it was under our original dynasty. Thus, we may want to try and remove these newer (and technically foreign) ideas and emulate our ancestors. Of course, if we choose this path, we will also have to choose how much we try and enforce the change on the commoners."
 china.74.a:0 "All of our subjects must rid themselves of traitorous customs!"
 china.74.b:0 "Encourage our subjects to adopt our new identity, but do not force it."
 china.74.c:0 "The court adopting this identity will be sufficient."
 china.74.dd:0 "Nonsense, we will bear the name of [Root.GetName] and continue to use Zhou rites."
 china.75.t:0 "The Conquest of Ying"
 china.75.d:0 "Our forces have captured the city of Ying, the former capital of the great state of Chu. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before, and ownership of such a sophisticated city is allowing us advance ourselves much more quickly than we otherwise would."
 china.75.a:0 "A new southern power has emerged."
 china.76.t:0 "Merchants from the North"
 china.76.a:0 "Merchants from the north have arrived in our capital recently selling new technologies that we haven't seen before. They also bring with them sophisticated knowledge of governance."
 china.76.a:0 "Bring them to our court, immediately!"
 china.76.b:0 "We have no need for them."
 china.77.t:0 "A Visit to the Court?"
 china.77.d:0 "It's customary that every lord send an envoy to the royal court periodically to present tribute and felicitations - shall we do so?"
 china.77.a:0 "Yes, send an envoy."
 china.77.b:0 "The Zhou king is hardly important these days, why should we bother?"
 china.78.t:0 "The ZhouLi Conference"
 china.78.d:0 "The growing discontent over the Rites of Zhou, and the unwillingless or lack of ability for the Hegemon to contain it, has caused much worry in the Court. The Son of Heaven has decided to call a conference to discuss the matter of reforming the rites. All royal DaFu have been ordered to the capital, and with their advice, the king will decide how to proceed with the hope of restoring order to the world and prevent rebellions against his authority."
 china.78.a:0 "Man proposes..."
 china.79.t:0 "End of the ZhouLi Conference"
 china.79.d:0 "The ZhouLi conference has concluded, and the king has made key decisions on matters relating to the rites. Whether this will help prevent rebellion or further incite it is yet to be determined."
 china.79.a:0 "... and Heaven disposes."
 china.80.t:0 "Arguments with the Reformists"
 china.80.d:0 "Today, during a session of the ZhouLi Conference, our DaFu became embroiled in a heated debate with members of the Reformist faction. They claim that our supposed clinging onto tradition will destroy our great dynasty from within. Word has got out about the incident, and some are upset over the disharmony that took place."
 china.80.a:0 "Blame those ingrates, not us!"
 china.81.t:0 "Tensions Eased with the ZhuHou"
 china.81.d:0 "It seems that our reformist-minded DaFu in the ZhouLi Conference have been conversing with some of the most discontent lords, promising them that the rites will certainly be changed to suit their needs in the near future. This has reduced tensions a bit."
 china.81.a:0 "True gentlemen."
 china.83.t:0 "The City of Bin"
 china.83.d:0 "With the fall of the Zhou dynasty, the city of Bin is of no significance anymore."
 china.83.a:0 "Damn"
 china.84.t:0 "A Visit to Lu"
 china.84.d:0 "Our Gong [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to take a visit to Lu to pay tribute, however, a couple of decades ago, there was an incident where we went to see the Marquess of Lu, but did not use proper etiquette. The marquess felt disrespected and considered our Gong too much like the Yi barbarians that live around us. The annals of Lu even referred to our Gong as a mere viscount because of the incident! Thus, we should probably put some effort into presenting ourselves more appropriately."
 china.84.a:0 "Yes, well said."
 china.84.b:0 "We bear the surname of Si, how could Lu be so impudent?"
 china.85.t:0 "Treasury Funds Misappropriated!"
 china.85.d:0 "It seems some funds in the Tianwang Coffers have been misappropriated. We can only expect this to happen more frequently the bigger our coffers are..."
 china.85.a:0 "The more you have, the more others want from you..."
 china.86.t:0 "Our Title Demoted!"
 china.86.d:0 "The Zhou court has sent an envoy to our court to tell us that they have demoted our title from Gong to Bo! This is a great insult and humiliation, and we can only hope to receive our old title back in the future..."
 china.86.a:0 "We are still dukes!!"
 china.87.t:0 "Our Title Restored!"
 china.87.d:0 "The Zhou court has sent an envoy to our court to reinstate our old title of Gong!"
 china.87.a:0 "Thank Heaven..."
 china.89.t:0 "Reestablishment of Fengjian"

 SEA_events.1.t:0 "The Spread of Pyu Culture"
 SEA_events.1.d:0 "The Pyu people originated from modern day Tibet, alongside the Jinghpo and Mranma. During the first millenium BC, they migrated down into Irrawaddy Valley and eventually formed the Pyu city states around 200 BC, becoming the first civilization in Burmese history. The Pyu partially displaced the Palaungic peoples who migrated from the east, as well as the previous inhabitants of Burma of which very little is known, except that they seemed to have survived in the far south until around 250 BC."

Railroading, specifically in this context, are events or certain things for nations that act as buffs or cheats to make them perform or act in a way closer to history. This can be a problem if you are playing in a region near them, i.e., playing as Armenia and not wanting Persia to roll up onto your border 10x stronger than they would be otherwise because there is an event that lets them annex Media for free. Disabling railroading will effect the game in ways unintended by developers, but it may be necessary depending on who you are trying to play as."

  axum.1.t:0 "Fall of Da'amat"
  axum.1.d:0 "Before the establishment of Axum, the Tigray plateau of northern Ethiopia was home to a kingdom known as D'mt. Archaeological evidence shows that the kingdom was influenced by Sabaeans from modern-day Yemen; scholarly consensus had previously been that Sabaeans had been the founders of Semitic civilization in Ethiopia, though this has now been refuted, and their influence is considered to have been minor. The Sabaean presence likely lasted only for a matter of decades, but their influence on later Aksumite civilization included the adoption of Ancient South Arabian script, which developed into Ge'ez script, and Ancient Semitic religion. Around 5th century BC Da'amat influence waned, and it desintegrated into many smaller succession kingdoms, one of which probably was Axum."
