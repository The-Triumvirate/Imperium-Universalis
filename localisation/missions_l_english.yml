 she_capture_deng_desc:0 "When king Wen of Chu launched an attack against us, he had to march through Deng first. Three loyal ministers of Deng urged their marquess to kill the Chu king as he was passing through their land, but he refused. After Chu had conquered us, he turned and conquered Deng, as well. The marquess's foolishness led to his state's demise, and we should conquer his former lands as retribution for allowing us to be annexed."

 she_regain_influence_title:0 "Regaining Influence"
 she_regain_influence_desc:0 "Shen was once a powerful state not too long ago. We held domination over the Zhou court during king Ping's reign, at the start of the Spring and Autumn period. The Zhou court has indeed lost much practical power, but they still have prestige and a degree of influence over the other Huaxia states.

 she_upgrade_fancheng_desc:0 "Fancheng is an extremely defendable position - it would be the site of famous historical battles such as the Battle of Fancheng during the Three Kingdoms period, and the Siege of Xiangyang during the Mongol invasion of China.

 guz_build_legit_desc:0 "We claim descent from the Shang dynasty through the cadet Motai branch of the Zi family.

 guz_yan_question_title:0 "The Yan Question"
 guz_yan_question_desc:0 "The state of Yan to our west is one that formerly annexed us, and we have only recently broken free. We cannot sit on the fence in regards to our diplomacy towards them - we can try to mend relations and become brotherly countries, or we can make them into our nemesis.

 shu_take_hanzhong2_title:0 "Conquer Hanzhong"
 shu_take_hanzhong2_desc:0 "With our northern border secure, we could look to our west for new expansion opportunities - specifically at Hanzhong.

 shu_develop_gov_title:0 "Reform our Government"
 shu_develop_gov_desc:0 "We are aware of the various states to the north that have a more sophisticated government than our own, though we've long ignored them. Maybe we should begin sending emissaries and leaning their way of life so that we can improve our own state?"

 shu_adopt_culture_title:0 "Introduce New Culture"
 shu_adopt_culture_desc:0 "As our contact with the Zhou states continues to grow, we have adopted more and more practices from them, while still retaining our local identity.
