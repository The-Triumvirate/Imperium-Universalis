		# Basically this is what will be explained in the DD

		### Enslavement
		# The army, during their sacking / raid, has been instructed to "prioritize" leaving the population alive. Still, it will not always be possible. Also, it is documented in primary sources that many enslavements in Antiquity had first the adult male population slain, and then most women and children were sold to slavery. Therefore, even if the goal of the besieging army is to take as many people alive as possible, many will resist and perish in the process. That's why we have separated Enslave into two options, whether the besieging army will be more "efficient" executing this task.
		# The maximum amount of population to be enslaved is determined by maximum capacity of the province (or, if the Popgrowth mechanics are not toggled, by a simple % of current population). Rural/tribal populations will be the most spared, and upper pops the most affected. Remember, this is all the population RELATIVE TO THE CAPACITY LIMIT, so if a province has 5 rural pops but a rural capacity of 15, it is already under
		# Values for each pop type. It's always 40% enslaved / 60% killed in Soft, and 80% s / 20% k in Hard. If less than 1 pop, won't be taken out. Remember that there will be simplified, automatic and hidden version of this event if the province has low development
		# Rural/tribal pops:	min 60% capacity, or max 20% if no Popgrowth mechanics enabled
		# Urban/common pops: 	min 40% capacity, or max 40% ....
		# Upper pops:			min 20% capacity, or max 75% .... (it's higher, as it gets promoted faster)

		# An example for this: a city with 15 commoners and 5 tribals, with capacities of 15 and 10. Minimums of 15x0.4 & 10x0.6 = 6 & 6. Current pops and minimums are 15 / 6, 5 / 6 -> possible 9 commoners and 0 tribals will be enslaved. If soft enslave, 9 x 0.4 = 36 thousand slaves, and 9 x 0.25 = 2.25 killed. Total population lost: 9 x (0.4 + 0.25) = 5.85 -> 5 pops lost.

		# To end this section, remember that enslavement is a process that takes A LOT of time and therefore some province modifiers will appear in every neighbor province that is either yours or the enemy's, and your army will be almost inmobile, and susceptible to attacks by the enemy. This is 2 months for light enslavement and 3 months for hard enslavement. So you better avoid doing this unless you have a complete control of the possible enemy's armies...
		# By the way, it is needed to add this modifier in both the current province and those nearby, because if done only in the current province, it just impedes armies to ENTER the province, but they can LEAVE it. Not fair, really

		### Colateral damage
		# value depending on how much money is being taken out. You take 1000, you may destroy up to 1000 in value. Devastation is the impact over things other than in buildings, and it will take some time to go away. Also, notice that as long as there is some value to be taken, ANY building is eligible to be hit. So don't think that because you won't cause 500 of value you can't hit a building valued 500 or higher.
		# Its formula is Devastation % = sack ratio x type of damage done.

	# In the event of a siege, several buildings may be colaterally destroyed. These will add a province flag into that province, and, as long as there is one such flags present, it will show a "building" called "Ruins". If you click on it (so, "upgrade" the ruins), the Repairs Planned building appears. This Repairs Planned building marks every province that will be repaired through this decision. So if you want to just repair the production buildings of your richest provinces, then build that just there, and then re-do this into another building, etc.
	# Remember that these flags and the ruins last for only FIVE years, after that the ruins are beyond repair and will be lost.
	# The cost of repairing such buildings is 75% of the original price, without any added cost modifiers.
