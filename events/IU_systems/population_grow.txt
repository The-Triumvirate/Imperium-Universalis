	# So, if we have a province with 1 rural population, it will need to fire this event six times. A 2-population will need just three times (2+2+2), and one at 6 or higher just once.
	# But again, the "spirit" of the event is to create an annual growth rate, that's why it takes the same time (30 x 6 = 180 years) to double population, be it from 1 to 2 or from 4 to 8.
	# Finally, this is supposing that the growth rate (capacity / current population) is constant, and it will not, so at higher values, growth will be way lower than the start, or just not happening at all. That's how we get a Logistic Function (S) instead of linear growth (/)
